<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often falter while processing stuttering-related disfluencies—such as involuntary
blocks and word repetitions—yielding inaccurate transcripts. A critical barrier to progress is the scarcity of large, annotated disfluent speech datasets. Therefore, we present an inclusive ASR design approach, leveraging large-scale self-supervised learning on standard speech followed by targeted fine-tuning and data augmentation on a smaller, curated dataset of disfluent speech. Our data augmentation technique enriches training datasets with various disfluencies, enhancing ASR processing of these speech patterns. Results show that fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0 with even a relatively small, labeled dataset, alongside data augmentation, can significantly reduce word error rates for disfluent speech. Our approach not only advances ASR inclusivity for people who stutter, but also paves the way for ASRs that can accommodate wider speech variations.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Stuttering</span> is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by moments of involuntary disruptions in the flow of speech when people who stutter experience a loss of control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. These disruptions manifest as <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">disfluencies</span> like word repetitions (e.g., ``my my my name is''), prolongations (e.g., ``mmmy name is''), and blocks or pauses (e.g., ``my n—ame is'') <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Although these and other types of disfluencies occur in everyday speech, they are markedly more frequent in individuals who stutter, a condition that affects over 80 million people globally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The prevalence and severity of these disfluencies can vary significantly across individuals, influenced by environmental and situational factors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The widespread integration of automatic speech recognition (ASR) into voice-activated artificial intelligence (voice AI) applications across sectors such as education, employment, home automation, and transportation presents a significant challenge for people who stutter. Although ASRs can achieve up to 95% word accuracy on standard speech <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, their performance markedly declines when processing disfluent speech, often failing to accurately decode the variations inherent in stuttering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. This discrepancy not only impacts people who stutter in their daily and professional lives but also amplifies societal biases. It leads to discrimination, restricts equal opportunities in automated services and employment, and contributes to difficulties in utilizing voice-activated services like automated phone systems, voice assistants (e.g., Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa), and biases in automated job interview scoring systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The effect of these biases is profound, often resulting in decreased job satisfaction and increased marginalization, as fluent speech is frequently preferred in employment settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Consequently, the disparity in ASR accuracy will exacerbate the marginalization of people who stutter, impacting all downstream applications.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Addressing the need for inclusive ASR models has prompted diverse strategies. One such approach involves providing alternative communication options, like typing commands for voice assistants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. While helpful, this method does not directly tackle the intrinsic bias within ASRs. In a more direct effort, initiatives such as Google's Project Euphonia and Relate have sought to refine the core ASR model, collecting diverse speech data to better accommodate conditions like dysarthria <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Nonetheless, these efforts have not specifically addressed the challenges presented by stuttering-related disfluent speech, characterized notably by its variability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In response to the distinctive needs of people who stutter, research has increasingly focused on creating ASR systems specifically designed for stuttering. The majority of such work has focused on disfluency detection, wherein disfluency events are detected and classified and subsequently adjusted, ignored, highlighted, or removed from speech prior to ASR processing, thereby enhancing accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Although datasets like SEP-28k and LibriStutter have emerged to support disfluency detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, there is a scarcity of datasets with paired transcripts and audio to train ASR models. Very few approaches have been proposed to tailor ASR models directly for stuttering. Lea et al., for instance, tuned Apple Speech framework model parameters using data on stuttering characteristics (e.g., distribution of duration of blocks) obtained from individuals who stutter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Similarly, Mitra et al. focused on tuning decoding parameters of ASRs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Other approaches have also been investigated to enhance ASR models, although they focus on other types of speech variations like dysarthria, dysphonia, or aphasia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper aims to address the aforementioned challenges and develop an accessible ASR for people who stutter using a combination of fine-tuning and data augmentation. A primary limitation in creating an ASR for stuttered speech is the absence of a comprehensive dataset covering various types of disfluencies and their variations among individuals who stutter. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel speech data augmentation method specifically designed for stuttered speech that also allows for the manipulation and control of disfluency types during the fine-tuning process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The core contributions of this paper, distinguishing it from prior efforts, are fourfold: (1) ASR fine-tuning for accessibility with a stuttering-specific focus: We investigate the impact of fine-tuning a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model with stuttered speech datasets of various sizes on ASR word error rate (WER) and semantic similarity, aiming to enhance model performance for disfluent speech. We specifically target disfluencies in stuttering, which vary greatly across people and environments, necessitating specialized solutions. (2) Disfluent speech data augmentation: An innovative data augmentation method designed specifically for stuttered speech is introduced, overcoming the challenges of limited data. This method provides precise control over the types, frequency, and placement of disfluencies within speech samples, enabling the enrichment of our dataset and more effective training of robust ASRs. (3) Accuracy bias analysis: We evaluate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating accuracy bias—the discrepancy in ASR performance when processing speech with and without stuttering. By comparing ASR performance against a baseline of non-stuttered speech, we assess the effectiveness of our strategies in promoting equitable ASR accuracy. (4) Diverse and realistic evaluation settings: We evaluate our fine-tuned ASR using speech from diverse contexts, including interview and reading videos, and assess its performance across various demographics of people who stutter. With these contributions, we anticipate our approach will advance the development of fair and accessible ASRs for individuals who stutter, with potential extensions to accommodate other speech differences featuring disfluencies.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our study leverages wav2vec 2.0, a large-scale, self-supervised model designed for speech processing. Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Inclusive ASR for Disfluent Speech: Cascaded Large-Scale Self-Supervised Learning with Targeted Fine-Tuning and Data Augmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> provides a visual overview of the model's architecture. Pre-trained on an extensive corpus of unlabeled speech, it can be subsequently fine-tuned on a smaller, targeted dataset. This model excels in constructing a contextually rich representation of speech through a series of lightweight components. Compared to larger end-to-end models such as Whisper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, wav2vec 2.0, although not a state-of-the-art model, offers a more computationally-efficient approach for our experiments, providing a balance of performance and feasibility. Additionally, it offers precise control over the training dataset, avoiding the potential for data leakage into test sets that could occur with Whisper due to its opaque training data. For fine-tuning, we utilize the `wav2vec2-base-960h' model variant from HuggingFace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, pre-trained on 960 hours of the LibriSpeech dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate our fine-tuned ASR's efficacy on non-disfluent speech, we generated a modified version of the FluencyBank dataset, termed FluencyBank-N, from which all apparent disfluencies have been removed. This variant was synthesized using the SpeechT5 text-to-speech (TTS) model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> in conjunction with a selection of pre-trained speaker vectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, aiming to produce speech that mirrors the original transcripts but without disfluencies. By carefully selecting and employing 10 distinct pre-trained speaker vectors, we ensured a varied vocal representation. This approach allows us to precisely assess how our ASR model performs on the FluencyBank dataset under the hypothetical scenario where the speakers exhibit no disfluencies.
We note that although synthetic speech is not identical to real speech, the performance of wav2vec 2.0 on this synthetic dataset is comparable to, albeit slightly worse than, its performance on the test set.

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the diversity shortfall in small stuttered speech datasets, our data augmentation strategy introduces a broader spectrum of disfluency events, more closely mirroring natural speech patterns observed in individuals who stutter. While the LibriStutter dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> represents a prior attempt at simulating stuttering through audio processing, it falls short in capturing the full complexity of the stuttering phenomena, notably in variability. In contrast, our method generates a richer assortment of disfluency events, including <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">word repetitions</span> (e.g., ``my my my name is''), <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">phrase repetitions</span> (e.g., ``my name my name my name is''), and <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">interjections</span> (e.g., ``um um my name uh is''), inserted at randomized locations and frequencies during ASR training, thereby producing a simulation that more accurately reflects the inherent variability in disfluent speech of real individuals. Although our approach does not cover every type of stuttered disfluency, the selected event types are crucial. They enhance the realism of the training data and help study the effectiveness of our augmented dataset, ultimately improving ASR accuracy for all types of stuttered disfluencies.</p>

We implemented a 6-fold cross-validation strategy, ensuring each fold contained utterances from two distinct speakers, with no speaker overlap across folds. This segmentation of FluencyBank into six parts based on speaker identity guarantees that any two folds are free from speaker overlap, whether across videos, utterances, or generated utterances. Such a methodological approach allows for a focused evaluation of ASR performance on voices not previously encountered during training, with augmentation applied only to utterances from speakers allocated to each specific fold.</p>

Training was conducted on an NVIDIA V100 GPU for about 55 epochs, or until no further reduction in loss was observed, employing early stopping to identify the most effective model configuration per fold. In addition, through experimentation with several hyperparameters, we set the learning rate to 6.25e-6, weight decay to 0.01, and use a batch size of 4 with gradient accumulation applied at each step. Additionally, to standardize input data, normalization procedures were applied to adjust casing and punctuation using the BasicTextNormalizer function from Whisper, available through the HuggingFace library <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.</p>

Our focus was on repetitions and interjections, identified through analysis of CHAT codes in FluencyBank transcripts. We found that 31% of utterances in the FluencyBank dataset contained at least one word and/or phrase repetition, and 59% included interjections, though other disfluency types were also noted. Our primary analysis remained focused on these disfluencies, which were also the key targets in our data augmentation process. Post fine-tuning and data augmentation, we observed a reduction in WER across all speakers and various age and gender demographics. Additionally, there was a decrease in disfluency-specific WER for each model configuration, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduced a new approach to improving ASR accuracy for individuals who stutter, overcoming previous limitations in dataset size and diversity with a novel data augmentation strategy that infuses new training samples with synthetic disfluencies. Our findings reveal that even minimal fine-tuning with disfluent speech significantly enhances ASR performance, as evidenced by reduced WER, with further improvements stemming from our data augmentation techniques.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Looking ahead, we plan to broaden our research to include a wider array of disfluency types, aiming for a more comprehensive representation of stuttered speech. We also seek to fine-tune our methodology to better align ASR-generated transcripts with the preferences of people who stutter, acknowledging that some may wish to see their disfluencies reflected in transcriptions to accurately convey their speech patterns. This aspiration underscores the importance of understanding the diverse needs and preferences of those who stutter. Ultimately, our research contributes to making ASR technology more accessible and adaptable, laying the groundwork for future innovations that accommodate a range of speech variations.</p>
