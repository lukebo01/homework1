<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Speech emotion recognition (SER) classifies human emotions in speech with a computer model.
Recently, performance in SER has steadily increased as deep learning techniques have adapted.
However, unlike many domains that use speech data, data for training in the SER model is insufficient.
This causes overfitting of training of the neural network, resulting in performance degradation.
In fact, successful emotion recognition requires an effective preprocessing method and a model structure that efficiently uses the number of weight parameters.
In this study, we propose using eight dataset versions with different frequency-time resolutions to search for an effective emotional speech preprocessing method.
We propose a 6-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model with efficient channel attention (ECA) to pursue an efficient model structure.
In particular, the well-positioned ECA blocks can improve channel feature representation with only a few parameters.
With the interactive emotional dyadic motion capture (IEMOCAP) dataset, increasing the frequency resolution in preprocessing emotional speech can improve emotion recognition performance.
Also, ECA after the deep convolution layer can effectively increase channel feature representation.
Consequently, the best result (79.37UA 79.68WA) can be obtained, exceeding the performance of previous SER models.
Furthermore, to compensate for the lack of emotional speech data, we experiment with multiple preprocessing data methods that augment trainable data preprocessed with all different settings from one sample.
In the experiment, we can achieve the highest result (80.28UA 80.46WA).</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Speech emotion recognition (SER) is the technique in which a computer can recognize the inherent emotional features of a human’s speech signal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
In particular, interest in the human-computer interaction (HCI) systems has arisen <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and SER has noticed that some applications, such as psychotherapy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and consultation calls <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, require emotional labor.
However, it is hard to understand how human speech emotions can be represented in terms of the exact values using common standards.
This is because each person’s method of recognizing emotions differs depending on their personality and culture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
The ambiguity of human emotions is one of the main challenges in developing an accurate SER model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, many studies have attempted to use the deep learning-based models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, that can be trained directly from the emotional speech data.
Among them, in recent, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based models trained with speech spectral features are proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
A CNN-based model has two advantages.
First, owing to the convolutional layer’s weight sharing, a relatively small number of trainable parameters can be used.
Second, a deep CNN layer model makes it possible to learn global context features using filters of only a small size <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
For the SER, it is essential to learn the linguistic features and the paralinguistic features of speech <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, the CNN model, which can learn the context of emotional speech utterances, performs better than the other structures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, to learn the overall context of the input data with a CNN-based model, a sufficient number of deep layers must be stacked, or a larger filter kernel must be used.
Therefore, attention modules have been proposed to cover the CNN layer’s weakness for the SER <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed a multiscale area attention, which applies the transformer-type attention mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to the CNN-based model.
This significantly improves the recognition performance by dividing the time-frequency spatial information into granular perspectives.
Guo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed spectral temporal channel attention, which is a modified version of bottleneck attention module (BAM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, it used not only focus on spatial features but also attention to channel features.
In addition, it has an independent attention learning structure in all the axes of the input features.
However, channel attention requires more learning parameters than spatial attention because of the two multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">More trainable parameters are required when examining the attention structure and considering the more diverse aggregated input features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
However, an increase in trainable parameters causes overfitting problems when trainable samples are leaked, such as in SER <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, in this study, we search for an efficient attention structure that can improve emotional feature expression with only a few learning parameters while maintaining a deep CNN-based model.
Through experiments, we observe that CNN’s channel features are essential for emotion classification performance.
Therefore, the efficient channel attention (ECA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> that can learn how to focus on the important channel features is applied to the SER problem for the first time.
With the interactive emotional dyadic motion capture (IEMOCAP) corpus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, we experiment to look for methods to use the ECA with a CNN-based model that is more suitable.
The ECA can find important channel features by focusing on the relationship between neighboring channels for the emotion classification.
To achieve this, the ECA uses a 1-D convolution layer.
Therefore, it is highly efficient because it requires only a few trainable parameters equal to the kernel size <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We also search for a more appropriate preprocessing method to better represent the emotional features.
Previous studies have preprocessed emotional speech signals using different methods; therefore, it is difficult to compare the results.
Therefore, we prepare the eight different types of preprocessed datasets.
Specifically, we choose the log-Mel spectrogram preprocessing method first.
We preprocess the speech signals with different and overlapping window sizes using short-term Fourier transformation (STFT).
We also evaluate the emotion classification performances of various CNN-based models.
As a result, we can observe that a preprocessing method with a large window size can accurately represent the emotional features.

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several experiments have shown that a CNN’s channel complexity significantly affects the SER.
Therefore, the ECA was applied to the SER domain for the first time.
The ECA efficiently improved the emotion classification results with only a few training parameters by extracting the relationship between the features of the neighboring channel.
It was shown, in particular, that using ECA is effective in the deep layer of the CNN model, which has many channels.</p>

To address this, we proposed STFT data augmentation, which uses various preprocessed settings in STFT to supplement the expression of emotional features.
Our proposed STFT data augmentation had a profound impact, resulting in a substantial enhancement in emotion classification performance, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach.
When using a CNN-based model with ECA applied, we achieved the highest performance to date (80.28UA 80.46WA 80.37ACC), inspiring confidence in this method’s potential.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many different attention methods have been proposed.
In this section, we present an overview of the development flow of CNN-based models using several attention methods.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The CNN can effectively learn local spatial features from the data.
It is also possible to learn the global spatial features, such as the context of the data when stacking multiple CNNs.
However, if the model stacks more layers, its complexity increases.
In the SER problem, increasing the model complexity is critical.
Therefore, to train the emotional context from the speech signals while sustaining the model complexity, most of studies have proposed a combination model a CNN and RNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
Although it is possible to learn the temporal features of speech using RNN, there are limitations to learning long sequences.
Therefore, to compensate for the limitations, many models that combine attention mechanisms with RNN have been proposed.</p>

This enables effective learning even for long sequences.
In addition, for more comprehensive context learning, ADRNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which uses residual connections and dilated convolution layers together, and ASRNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, which compensates for the shortcomings of RNN through a sliding RNN method, have been proposed.</p>

However, models consisting of CNN and RNN models in parallel are proposed to independently learn spatio-temporal features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.
Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> proposed a structure that separates LSTM and CNN in parallel and applies independent attention.

Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> demonstrated effective emotional feature learning only through self-attention after the CNN layer for the spatial context learning.</p>

Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed the ATDA, which applied independent self-attention to all feature axes (temporal, frequential, and channel) to compensate for the weakness of temporal feature learning owing to the lack of an RNN.
Guo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed STC, which is a more efficient attention method for all feature axes of the CNN structure.</p>

If the windowing length is longer, the frequency resolution increases; however, the resolution in time decreases.
If the windowing length is shorter, the frequency resolution decreases, however, the time resolution increases.
Therefore, we need to determine which features are more important in terms of time or frequency.
For this purpose, we performed our experiment by using eight different settings during preprocessing.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We must set an appropriate number of the weight filters and kernel sizes to better train with this convolution layer.
Therefore, in this study, we explored the trainable parametric efficiency in a CNN-based model for speech emotion recognition.
We mainly focus on some weight filters called “channel size”.
The channel size in the convolution layer is a hyperparameter related to the information capacity of the neural network.
If we use many weight filters, spatial information can be sensitively extracted from the input data.
However, this leads to a more robust overfitting of the training dataset.
We design a 6-layer CNN architecture to determine an adequate channel size for speech emotion recognition.
This is explained in detail in the following section.</p>

However, when more filters were used in the model, the representation capacity of the filters weakened.
To overcome this situation, we adopt the ECA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> in the CNN-based model, which can effectively improve the representation of the filters.
The ECA is a channel attention architecture proposed by Wang et al.. Learning the relationship between different filters and focusing on the important ones is possible with fewer trainable parameters.
We experimented with the application of an ECA suitable for a CNN-based SER model.
As a result, increasing the filter’s representation in the convolution layer helps to extract emotional features.</p>

These components are used to attend to the crucial information from input features.
Each component’s role is as follows.
A query is a ”question” about what is essential in the input features.
The key is ”hint,” which uses how similar the query is.
This helps to find the most appropriate information in the input features.
The value is the ”real answer” that exists in pairs with keys and is used as the output features of self-attention.</p>

In the first step, each query is multiplied with the multiple keys to obtain the relevant score matrix.
In the second step, the score matrix is represented by a probability distribution within each query using the Softmax function.
In the final step, the output is represented by a linear combination of all the values with a probability distribution.
In summary, the output is the weighted value obtained that is most closely related to the query indirectly through the keys.</p>

The ECA structure can be divided into three steps.
The first involves the preparation of a query.

We used global average pooling, which can contain temporal-frequency features in each channel without trainable parameters.

We trained the channel feature’s relation with a 1-D convolution layer to obtain the score.
Specifically, the number of neighboring channel queries that train the relation with the target channel query is determined by the kernel size of the 1-D convolution layer.</p>

Next, a key difference from the original ECA is the omission of batch normalization.
This change is made because batch normalization tends to extract global features of speech data rather than individual emotional features.</p>

We searched for more appropriate ECA block settings for the CNN-based model.
To achieve this, we compared the different experiments using several kernel sizes and block positions in the model.
Consequently, unlike the original ECA method used in all layers after the convolution block, using some convolution blocks with many channel features can be effective for emotion recognition performance.
This shows that the ECA works well when the complexity of the filter increases.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p13.1" class="ltx_p">In particular, the effectiveness of ECA can be increased when augmentation data are used for training.
Typically, sufficient data are required to use an attention-structured neural network effectively.
Therefore, we used eight different datasets as the augmentation data, as listed in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table II ‣ V-B Data Preprocessing ‣ V Experiment Setting and Results ‣ Searching for Effective Preprocessing Method and CNN-based Architecture with Efficient Channel Attention on Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.
Consequently, the performance difference between the model combined with the ECA and the model without the ECA is visible.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most speech emotion datasets have an unbalanced distribution, depending on the emotion labels.
Therefore, when we use cross entropy as a loss function, the model can be focused on a relatively large number of specific emotion labels (neutral and happiness).
In addition, emotion classification is complex, depending on the label.
For example, “happiness” and “angry” are often misclassified.
Therefore, we used weighted focal loss to deal with those specific situations.
The weighted focal loss can be expressed as follows.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The IEMOCAP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> is the most popular dataset used in the SER problem.
In this dataset, ten individual actors (five men and five women) recorded their voices, facial movements, and overall behavior for five sessions to understand human emotions in various situations.
The IEMOCAP’s data are divided into an improvised set, which contains improvised acting, and a script, which acts through dialogue.
Three or more annotators manually classified the emotional speeches, and the final decision was made through a majority vote.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The data samples that we used in the experiment are as follows.
We selected only the Improvised set, considering situations in which human emotions can appear naturally.
Next, we choose five emotional classes corresponding to “angry”, “sadness”, “happiness”, “neutral” and “excited”.
These classes are commonly used in various experiments.
Moreover, to compensate for the data sample’s number of “happiness,” “excited” is considered as “happiness”.
The experiments were conducted using 2943 speech data samples containing four emotional classes (angry:289, sadness:608, happiness:947, neutral:1099).</p>

Therefore, the lengths of the speech samples were consistent at 6 s, which was slightly longer than the average.
Specifically, if the speech data were shorter than 6 s, zero padding was performed at the beginning and end of the signal with the same length for the signal position in the center.
If the speech was longer than 6 s, both the beginning and ends of the signal were cut to the same size to contain as long an utterance as possible.</p>

A CNN-based model has a structure in which the channel size increases as the layer deepens; therefore, the complexity of the channel features in deep layers is relatively high.
Based on that situation, we want to determine where the ECA block can be more effective in helping to train the channel features.
Specifically, the experiment was conducted by sequentially adding the ECA blocks starting from the sixth convolution layer, which was the deepest layer in the model.</p>

An interesting result shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ V-G Augmentation Method with Different Version of STFT Datasets ‣ V Experiment Setting and Results ‣ Searching for Effective Preprocessing Method and CNN-based Architecture with Efficient Channel Attention on Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> is that the CNN model (79.66 UA 80.50 WA 80.08 ACC) and the ECA CNN (80.28 UA 80.46 WA 80.37 ACC) model exhibited the highest performance.
In particular, the CNN-based model with ECA blocks showed 0.8% higher based on ACC than the ascending experimental result.
In addition, the CNN-based model with ECA blocks (red line) is usually 0.2% to 0.82% higher than that of the CNN model (blue line).
In other words, the multiple preprocessing augmentation method can significantly improve the learning of emotional features using ECA blocks.</p>

<div id="S5.SS7.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS7.p5.1" class="ltx_p">From these two experiments, we can observe that the multiple preprocessing augmentation method can compensate for the training problem with a few speech-emotional data samples, which is one of the difficulties in SER.
In addition, the ECA blocks can work more effectively using the data augmentation method.
This method achieved the highest performance (80.28 UA 80.46 WA 80.37 ACC).</p>

this is because the combination of deep CNN layers and ECA is an efficient structure for extracting emotional context.
In addition, the insufficient expressions of emotional features can be reinforced using the STFT augmentation method.
Therefore, for the SER, it is important to increase the representation of the emotional feature data and effectively learn the context within it.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study proposes a promising and more effective preprocessing method and an ECA module for SER, offering the potential for significant advancements in the field.
Our experiment, conducted with eight different preprocessing datasets from the IEMOCAP corpus, revealed a significant finding: a spectrogram with a higher frequency resolution is more effective in training emotional features, providing valuable insight for future research in the field.
Our study is the first study to apply an ECA to the SER.
We achieved significantly better results than previous models by applying ECA to our CNN-based model with an effective preprocessing method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Considering these results, correctly understanding the relationship between the channel features in the CNN structure can be a clue to understanding how to distinguish emotions.
However, the ECA is limited in that it only considers the relationship between neighboring channels.
In future work, we will look for attention structures that are efficient but can learn the relationships between channel features more broadly.
In addition, it is necessary to determine a better preprocessing method for emotion recognition by analyzing the frequency features associated with each emotion.</p>
