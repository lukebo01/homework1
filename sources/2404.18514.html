<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Speech emotion recognition (SER) is constantly gaining attention in recent years due to its potential applications in diverse fields and thanks to the possibility offered by deep learning technologies. However, recent studies have shown that deep learning models can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we systematically assess this problem by examining the impact of various adversarial white-box and black-box attacks on different languages and genders within the context of SER. We first propose a suitable methodology for audio data processing, feature extraction, and CNN-LSTM architecture. The observed outcomes highlighted the significant vulnerability of CNN-LSTM models to adversarial examples (AEs). In fact, all the considered adversarial attacks are able to significantly reduce the performance of the constructed models. Furthermore, when assessing the efficacy of the attacks, minor differences were noted between the languages analyzed as well as between male and female speech. In summary, this work contributes to the understanding of the robustness of CNN-LSTM models, particularly in SER scenarios, and the impact of AEs. Interestingly, our findings serve as a baseline for

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The exploration of automatic emotional state detection from vocal expressions has drawn considerable attention in the contemporary era, primarily due to its potential applicability in a broad spectrum of fields such as human-computer interaction, psychology, entertainment, and education <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The introduction of deep learning techniques has markedly improved the performance of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) models, fostering the development of numerous applications for public use <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, recent studies have underscored the vulnerability of deep learning models to Adversarial Examples (AEs) – carefully crafted input samples designed to mislead the model into producing erroneous predictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. This susceptibility could trigger serious consequences in an SER context, especially in applications that are integral to safety. Evaluating the robustness of SER models is crucial, given their prospective use in areas such as affective computing, human-robot interaction, and mental health monitoring. By assessing and enhancing the resilience of these models, researchers can aid in the creation of reliable and trustworthy tools for these vital real-world applications.

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years a novel branch of scientific research has been studying the impact of AEs on SER tasks. Research in this area primarily aims to gauge the resilience of SER systems against various forms of attacks, and to devise methodologies to enhance model performance in the face of such threats <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Despite these efforts, the subject matter remains largely unexplored, necessitating further investigation to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how different attack techniques could potentially impact system performance. The outcomes of such research could, for instance, highlight specific types of attacks that are exceptionally proficient at misleading the model, or indicate that the model exhibits greater robustness against attacks that alter certain input data features. Furthermore, the study may reveal that a specific language or gender is more susceptible to these attacks.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although the impact of adversarial examples (AEs) on image models has been extensively studied, their application to speech emotion recognition (SER) models is lacking research. Furthermore, it is not possible to draw the same conclusions since the input data of image classification and SER models are only superficially similar. In fact, while the success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based architectures has been extended to the audio processing domain, the input samples used in the audio domain differ from those in the image domain in two main aspects: a) they often consist of sparse matrices, with most entries close to zero, and b) they are not easily segmentable, meaning that the same sound source (i.e., object) is spread across the matrix and is not contiguous as in the case of image segmentation. We believe that these differences warrant further investigation into the use of AEs in SER tasks.

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Following an initial exploration of the scientific literature pertaining to principal techniques and methodologies in SER and Adversarial Machine Learning, an optimal neural network model was identified to address the problem at hand.
Given that there is no single model architecture that performs well across multiple languages in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, we designed a model consisting of a fusion of CNN and LSTM, and is trained using log Mel-spectrograms derived from audio samples embodying diverse emotional states. The current paper focuses on multiple languages and scrutinizes the impacts of various adversarial attacks on speech data from both genders. To this end, three distinct datasets are utilized: EmoDB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> for German, EMOVO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> for Italian, and Ravdess <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> for English. A conscious decision was made to design and educate our unique model to ensure maximum flexibility during experimentation, rather than depending on pre-existing pre-trained models that may not yield satisfactory outcomes across all languages.

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Interestingly, a multitude of attacks were employed with the objective of assessing their influence on the established models. A broad spectrum of varied attack methodologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> was assessed, and, when feasible, diverse parameter sets were employed. The white-box attacks included were Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, Basic Iterative Method (BIM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, DeepFool <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and Carlini &amp; Wagner (C&amp;W) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. For the black-box attacks, PixelAttack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and BoundaryAttack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> were utilized in our experimentation.

<p id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">SER represents the computational challenge of discerning a speaker’s emotional state by examining the acoustic properties of their speech signal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Emotions, being a crucial component of human communication, are manifested through various speech facets including pitch, tempo, intensity, and spectral features.

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">SER is a potent instrument, with its utility extending to a range of fields including virtual assistant development, emotion detection in customer service, and mental health surveillance. This paper provides a concise review of some pioneering studies and their respective application areas.
Among the earliest researches, Nakatsu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> explored the application of SER in an interactive movie system. This system not only allowed viewers to watch the narrative but also to engage with it, employing emotion recognition to facilitate spontaneous interactions among computer characters.
In a different context, Petrushin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> concentrated on identifying emotional states in telephone call center dialogues. Here, understanding the caller’s mental state proved beneficial in decision support systems for tasks such as prioritizing voice messages, assigning suitable agents for responses, or categorizing voice mails based on the emotions expressed by the caller. Their study revealed anger as the most identifiable emotion.
Further, France et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> used acoustical characteristics as markers of depression and suicide risk, aiding therapists in comprehending their patients’ concealed emotions and overall mental state.
Lastly, Schuller et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed a method that combined acoustic features and linguistic information in the automotive industry to enhance car ride safety by monitoring the driver’s mental state. Remarkably, this approach could trigger safety measures, potentially preventing accidents.

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The research paper by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> categorizes datasets for SER into three distinct types, based on the method of sample collection. These are simulated, semi-natural, and natural speech datasets. Among these, the simulated datasets are the most prevalent. They are synthesized by trained speakers who articulate the same text, each time embodying a different emotion. Such datasets typically portray a standard set of emotions and, due to their acted nature, exhibit less noise and realism in comparison to datasets of natural speech <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. The datasets utilized in the present study are all of the simulated kind.
<br class="ltx_break">One of the most frequently used datasets for SER tasks is the <em id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Berlin Database of Emotional Speech (EMO-DB)</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. This dataset features ten actors, evenly split by gender, who simulate a range of emotions while uttering ten German sentences of varying lengths. Specifically, seven emotions (neutral, anger, fear, joy, sadness, disgust, and boredom) are represented across approximately 800 sentences, including 700 primary samples and some secondary versions. The recordings were conducted in an anechoic chamber, and the resultant material was subjected to an automated listening test. Each sentence was assessed by a panel of 20 listeners. Additionally, electroglottograms are provided to facilitate more precise extraction of prosodic and voice quality features.
<br class="ltx_break">The <em id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS)</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> is a comprehensive, gender-balanced dataset. It comprises emotional speech and song recordings from 24 professional North American actors (12 female, 12 male), each contributing 104 sentences. This results in a total of 7356 speech and 3036 song samples, including both facial and vocal expressions. The speech component encapsulates a spectrum of emotions such as calm, happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust, whereas the song component encompasses calm, happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. Each emotional expression is represented at two levels of intensity: normal and strong, complemented by a neutral expression. The validation process for RAVDESS involved two stages, with an initial group of 247 raters from North America followed by another group of 72 participants.
<br class="ltx_break">The <em id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">EMOVO</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> dataset, on the other hand, is the inaugural emotional corpus tailored for the Italian language. It consists of recordings from six actors (three males and three females), each delivering 14 sentences that simulate seven emotions: disgust, fear, anger, joy, surprise, sadness, and neutral. These recordings, made using professional equipment in the Fondazione Ugo Bordoni laboratories, total 588, with each actor contributing approximately 10 minutes of material. This culminates in an overall database duration of one hour. The validation of the EMOVO dataset involved two distinct groups of 24 individuals, achieving an overall recognition accuracy of 80%.</p>

The authors further explore the potential of adversarial examples in enhancing model security through adversarial training. By integrating adversarially crafted examples into the training set, they managed to decrease the error rate by approximately 10 percentage points. Furthermore, the use of a GAN to generate examples yielded superior results. Specifically, the generator was programmed to alter adversarial examples with the aim of deceiving a network that differentiates between adversarial and genuine examples. Interestingly, they discovered that the inclusion of a random noise layer did not benefit SER, a finding that contrasts with its impact on images.

For EMOVO, the excluded labels were <em id="S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">sad</em> and <em id="S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">angry</em>, while for Ravdess, the <em id="S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">calm</em>, <em id="S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">neutral</em>, and <em id="S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">angry</em> labels were discarded. Similarly to the <em id="S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.9" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">angry</em> label in EmoDB, the <em id="S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.10" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">neutral</em> label in Ravdess was disproportionately represented and its exclusion rectified this imbalance.</p>

The <em id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">categorical_crossentropy</em> serves as the loss function. To mitigate overfitting, an <em id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">EarlyStopping</em> callback is introduced with a tolerance of 10 epochs, which observes the validation loss. Failing to observe an improvement over 10 epochs prompts the restoration of the weights corresponding to the optimal validation loss. Moreover, a <em id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">ReduceLROnPlateau</em> callback is implemented to decrease the learning rate upon observing no improvement in validation loss over six epochs. This strategy aims to prevent the model from straying from the ideal solution due to an excessive learning rate, while also promoting convergence by adopting smaller steps towards the cost function’s optimal solution with a diminished learning rate. The underlying theory is that as the model nears a suboptimal solution with the current learning rate, it oscillates around the global minimum. Reducing the rate allows for smaller steps towards the cost function’s optimal solution. The validation loss serves as the metric for this callback, and the learning rate is reduced by a factor of 0.1 when there is no improvement in the validation loss for six epochs.</p>

(LOSO) cross-validation method, which designates each unique speaker as a test set.
Nonetheless, this research deviates from the norm, opting for a conventional
train/validation/test partition due to the inconsistency in the number of actors across
datasets, which inevitably yields diverse test sets. Such disparity could potentially skew performance assessments when juxtaposing attacks on varying languages and genders.
In particular, the data was apportioned into three splits, with proportions of 64%, 16%, and 20% respectively. To ensure a more reliable estimation of the performance metrics, this procedure was reiterated thrice, each time employing a distinct random seed.</p>

The method manipulates machine learning models by introducing minimal perturbations to the input data, thereby inducing the model to generate erroneous predictions. Specifically designed to exploit the learning mechanism of neural networks, FGSM utilizes the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data to augment the input data in a way that maximizes the loss.

This iterative process seeks to ascertain the shortest distance from the original input to the decision boundary of the threat model. The underlying premise of the DeepFool technique is the local approximation of highly nonlinear deep neural networks (NNs) by linear decision boundaries. This assumption allows the authors to analytically formulate the optimal solution to this simplified problem and subsequently construct the AE. Given that NNs are not strictly linear, the algorithm incrementally moves towards the derived solution, repeating the process until a genuine AE is discovered. The DeepFool algorithm utilizes the resulting gradient to determine the optimal direction and magnitude of the perturbations necessary to induce a misclassification by the model.

It modifies the objective and the primary constraint of the AE generation optimization problem, as initially proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. However, the constraint under consideration possesses a highly non-linear nature, which prompts the authors to recast it in a form more conducive to optimization. Consequently, the optimization problem is reformulated by integrating the constraint within the objective, as shown below:</p>

Its capability to locate AEs with minimal perturbations, which are challenging for human detection, underscores its potency. Moreover, its superiority over other gradient-based attacks is evidenced by its ability to bypass the computationally intensive task of gradient computation with respect to the input.</p>

Among these, PixelAttack exhibits a distinct efficacy, setting itself apart from the rest. Its effectiveness is particularly pronounced for EMOVO and Ravdess, whereas it shows less impact on EmoDB. Despite this discrepancy, the minimal perturbations it introduces to the samples, as elaborated in the succeeding section, underscore its impressive performance.

Across all three datasets, the JSMA attack emerges as the most potent, reducing the accuracy to approximately 1-2%.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The performance of all attacks on the EmoDB dataset is reasonable. The simple yet effective FGSM reduces the accuracy to approximately 10%, while BIM, DeepFool, and C&amp;W yield similar results at around 6.5%. Interestingly, BoundaryAttack, a black-box attack operating with less information, outperforms the latter, suggesting that a successful attack can be executed with minimal or no information about the target.
<br class="ltx_break">In the EMOVO dataset, FGSM exhibits an unusual efficiency, ranking second and surpassing its iterative BIM variant. The BIM-DeepFool-C&amp;W trio performs similarly, achieving around 8% accuracy, on par with BoundaryAttack.
<br class="ltx_break">In the case of Ravdess, BIM-DeepFool-C&amp;W again generates similar results, this time around 5.6%, whereas BoundaryAttack does not maintain the same level of performance as observed in the other datasets.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the comparative analysis of the three languages, the aggregate results exhibit remarkable similarity. The arithmetic mean of accuracies derived from white-box attacks by AEs is the lowest for EmoDB, registering at 0.063, followed by Ravdess at 0.067, and lastly, EMOVO at 0.068. This allows us to infer with confidence that German, Italian, and English demonstrate equivalent susceptibility in the context of a SER task. Further exploration of this subject will be undertaken in the succeeding discourse.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Turning our attention to the variance between male and female samples, white-box attacks proved to be more successful on male subjects in 9 out of 15 instances. In the case of EMOVO, this trend is discernible in 4 out of 5 instances, a noteworthy observation given the higher accuracy for males compared to females in the original dataset. Likewise, for Ravdess, male samples proved more susceptible in 3 instances. Conversely, for EmoDB, women were more impacted by 3 out of 5 attacks. The disparity is rather pronounced in certain attacks, with the accuracy differing by approximately 0.04 (excluding PixelAttack), while in other instances, the variation is around 0.01.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, JSMA emerges as the most potent assault, substantially undermining the performance of models across all languages. The trio of BIM, DeepFool, and C&amp;W exhibits a consistent performance across all cases. Even with its unassuming complexity, FGSM has demonstrated its efficacy across all three datasets, with a notable impact on EMOVO. Moreover, despite its black-box characteristics, BoundaryAttack achieves commendable results in two out of the three cases. We have also evidenced how PixelAttack, by altering merely a handful of pixels, can induce significant deviations in a model’s behavior.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The susceptibility of diverse languages to white-box attacks exhibits no marked disparities. The languages under scrutiny, namely German, Italian, and English, all demonstrate susceptibility to adversarial incursions. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that AEs derived from male audio samples typically yield higher efficacy, notably within the context of the EMOVO and Ravdess datasets.

Despite this, the deformations were not adequate to guarantee a robust defense against all forms of AEs attacks. These observations underscore the pronounced susceptibility of the SER task to such attacks when addressed using a CNN-LSTM model trained on log Mel-spectrograms.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we executed a series of five white-box attacks and two black-box attacks. Despite the disparity in their quantities, a comparative analysis of these two categories is still significant. This significance stems from the distinct configuration of PixelAttack, which leads to considerably dissimilar results compared to other forms of attacks. Moreover, a closer inspection of the internal procedures utilized by these algorithms allows us to perceive this comparison in the context of gradient-based (white-box) and gradient-free (black-box) attacks, and the varying degrees of access to the model’s information.

On the other hand, black-box techniques demonstrate wider variances.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The model trained on the EMOVO dataset, despite exhibiting the lowest accuracy on the original data, outperforms the other models in terms of resistance to AEs. Specifically, it achieves superior performance when subjected to 4 out of 7 attack methods, thus suggesting a diminished impact of the attacks on this model. Consequently, it can be deduced that the model trained on Italian samples exhibits a marginally higher resilience.
<br class="ltx_break">In contrast, models trained on the Ravdess dataset present a different scenario. These models, while attaining the highest accuracy on the original data, demonstrate a drop in performance when exposed to AEs, thereby making them the least resistant in 4 out of the 7 cases. This is particularly alarming given that the Ravdess model was trained with a larger dataset and over a greater number of epochs, factors that would typically contribute to increased robustness. Crucially, this underscores the fact that the resilience of a model to AEs is not solely contingent on the volume of the training data, but also its quality.

Although the performance differences among languages are relatively small, the experiments provide valuable insights.
<br class="ltx_break">Our findings indicate a heightened susceptibility of the English language to the discussed attacks, evidenced by its diminished accuracy notwithstanding its superior performance on the pristine data.

This pattern was not exclusive to the aforementioned cases but was also observed in 4 out of 5 instances within the EMOVO dataset, despite the higher initial data accuracy of male subjects compared to their female counterparts.
In the case of the Ravdess dataset, the AEs proved to be more effective in 3 instances concerning male subjects, who, interestingly, exhibited marginally lower initial data accuracy. However, in the EmoDB dataset, a contrasting trend was observed. Here, 3 out of 5 attacks were more potent on female subjects, who had initially achieved higher accuracy scores on the original data compared to male subjects.
In summary, the data suggests that the gender with superior initial data accuracy is more susceptible to attacks in two out of the three datasets analyzed. Consequently, this leads to diminished accuracy on AEs relative to the other gender. This indicates that the model’s resilience to gradient-based attacks on the best-performing gender cannot be reliably predicted solely based on the performance of the original data.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The scientific community has been increasingly focusing on adversarial machine learning in recent years. Despite the surge in the development and application of new techniques for SER, the susceptibility of these methods to various forms of attacks has not been sufficiently explored. This paper aims to fill this research gap by evaluating the robustness of SER systems against AEs. Our study scrutinizes three languages—German, Italian, and English—sourced from distinct datasets (EmoDB, EMOVO, and Ravdess, respectively) to discern potential disparities among them. Furthermore, we have incorporated a gender-based perspective into our analysis, investigating the differential impacts of adversarial attacks on male and female speech. Importantly, the implementation of the presented experimental set-up is publicly available at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LIMUNIMI/thesis_adversarial_ml_audio" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/LIMUNIMI/thesis_adversarial_ml_audio</a> ensuring full reproducibility of the achieved results. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We devised a pipeline to standardize the samples across the three languages and extract log Mel-spectrograms. Our methodology involved augmenting the datasets using pitch shifting and time stretching techniques, while maintaining a maximum sample duration of 3 seconds. Specifically, we generated eight distinct versions of the processed data, each differing in the data normalization method applied. The outcomes of our experiments were highly encouraging, demonstrating that the Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) models performed optimally and consistently when standardized log Mel-spectrograms were used, across all datasets.
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the SER task, we established a uniform CNN-LSTM architecture across all datasets, thereby ensuring methodological consistency for attack comparisons. Through rigorous experimentation with diverse configurations of the neural network, optimal performance was achieved with a modestly sized CNN and 256 bidirectional LSTM units. Subsequent hyperparameter tuning further refined the performance for each dataset. This design strategy yielded high accuracy results on the EmoDB, EMOVO, and Ravdess test sets, with respective accuracies of 90.92%, 89.52%, and 91.76%. These findings underscore the efficacy of employing a CNN-LSTM network trained on log Mel-spectrograms for the SER task while being in line with the state of the art.
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Upon completion of the model development phase, we assessed the vulnerability of the resultant models to the previously mentioned attacks, under varying parameter configurations. Our empirical investigation revealed a substantial susceptibility of the SER task to AEs. Each examined attack method, including the relatively straightforward FGSM or PixelAttack, which was designed to alter a minimal number of features, successfully misled the network’s predictions. In light of these findings, it is evident that the CNN-LSTM model did not exhibit resilience against any of the employed attack techniques. Consequently, we advocate for the exploration of more robust models or alternative training data to enhance system robustness.
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Our research findings indicate that amongst the multitude of attacks considered, Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) surfaced as the most potent. The optimal configuration of its parameters led to a significant dip in accuracy rates, resulting in 1.31  2.23  and 1.73 for EmoDB, EMOVO, and Ravdess datasets, respectively. Furthermore, JSMA introduces only a minuscule degree of perturbation into the AEs. It is second only to PixelAttack, which is specifically tailored to alter a minimal number of pixels per spectrogram, in achieving the least perturbation.
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The comparative analysis between white-box and black-box methodologies revealed that black-box techniques exhibit superior performance and minimal perturbation in two out of the three cases, specifically with BoundaryAttack. This is notwithstanding their limited access to information about the targeted model. Using BoundaryAttack, we recorded a significant drop in the accuracy of EmoDB, EMOVO, and Ravdess to 4.54  7.6  and 20.38  respectively. This observation is alarming as it implies that attackers can potentially achieve remarkable results without any understanding of the model’s internal operation, simply by scrutinizing its output.

<div id="S4.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p7.1" class="ltx_p">When we evaluated the impacts of the attacks across the three languages, no substantial difference in performance was observed. However, the results suggest that English appears to be the most susceptible, while Italian displays the highest resistance.

<p id="S4.p9.1" class="ltx_p">To encapsulate, we have introduced a reliable and efficacious approach for the training of a deep neural network for SER, which has been corroborated on three distinct languages. Our exploratory study on the model’s susceptibility to various adversarial attacks has unveiled substantial vulnerabilities to all examined techniques, even revealing critical deficiencies in the face of black-box attacks. The empirical trials showed that the proposed method does not exhibit considerable disparities in attack performance across different languages or gender samples, but only minor variances.

<p id="S6.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Other than the added dropout probability, the parameter configuration for EmoDB is curiously identical to the original, which probably explains why the results were better than the other datasets. The intuition to add the Dropout layer proved to be correct, as all models produced better results with dropout probabilities other than 0. Surprisingly, Ravdess required greater regularization by preferring higher dropout probabilities, despite having the largest amount of data.
<br class="ltx_break">The training performs better with an initial learning rate equal to the original one for EmoDB and Ravdess, while it is smaller for EMOVO. EMOVO also has the smallest batch size, indicating that it needs a slower training process to converge to the optimum, while Ravdess prefers larger batches.
<br class="ltx_break">To evaluate the effectiveness of the hyperparameter tuning process, we repeated the training using the same train/validation/test sets as in the previous paragraph but with the parameters found during tuning.

<p id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the experiments, it can be concluded that using 5 iterations is sufficient to find the minimum perturbation in all datasets, as the accuracy results are the same as when using 20 iterations. However, when using only one iteration, the best results are achieved with EmoDB, followed by EMOVO, and then Ravdess. Increasing the number of iterations reduces the difference between different languages, and the examples in Ravdess cause the most misclassification, followed by EmoDB and EMOVO. In the best cases, female samples are more vulnerable to attack in EmoDB and Ravdess, while for EMOVO, male samples have lower accuracy.

<p id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Using more iterations in EMOVO and EmoDB leads to the discovery of AEs with less perturbation, which they are more efficient in causing misclassification compared to using only 1 iteration. However, in the case of Ravdess, even with only 1 iteration, the perturbation is lower than in other cases, although the differences are minimal, as in the other two cases. This suggests that AEs are already effective with just 1 iteration, and with more effort, it is possible to achieve more efficient threats with a similar degree of perturbation.

Specifically, for the studied context, a small number of iterations is sufficient to reach the minimal perturbation. When iterations are sufficient, AEs can significantly degrade the model’s performance, but at the cost of introducing a relatively high degree of perturbation. The algorithm works well for all languages and produces essentially the same results for both male and female voices.</p>

<br class="ltx_break">The attack is very effective in compromising the proper functioning of the network and it performs almost equally well among the considered languages. It is worth noting that the female samples of EmoDB are more affected by the attack compared to the males, whereas for EMOVO, the attack is more effective on males with a different value of theta than that used for females. Similarly, for Ravdess, the attack is more efficacious on males with a value of +1 and on females with a value of -0.5, although the scores obtained in both cases are very similar.

It is worth noting that the average perturbation is smaller with a <em id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px4.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">theta</em> value of 1 than with a value of -0.5, which is somewhat unexpected. Negative values seem to introduce more perturbation than positive ones, with the worst results obtained using a value of -1 for EMOVO and Ravdess, and a value of -0.5 for EmoDB.
<br class="ltx_break">When comparing the results for men and women, it appears that men generally receive less perturbation for EmoDB and Ravdess, regardless of the <em id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px4.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">theta</em> value used. The situation for EMOVO is more complex, with men experiencing less perturbation for positive values of <em id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px4.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">theta</em> and more perturbation for negative values. The difference in perturbation between males and females is generally less pronounced for positive <em id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px4.p3.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">theta</em> values, and more pronounced for negative values.
<br class="ltx_break">Overall, we are very satisfied with the level of mean perturbation introduced, especially considering the low levels of accuracy obtained. While introducing only a slight perturbation, this attack results in a considerably high degree of degradation in the model’s performance.

<p id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Increasing the value of <em id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px6.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">th</em> reduces the computation time required to generate AEs. This black-box attack is notably slower than most other white-box attacks, except for C&amp;W. In the case of EmoDB, the time required for generating AEs with <em id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px6.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">th</em>=5 and <em id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px6.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">th</em>=10 is almost the same, whereas, for EMOVO, the three results show the least amount of fluctuation.</p>

<div id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px6.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, this black-box attack is capable of misclassifying a sample by perturbing only a small number of values in the log Mel-spectrogram. However, it requires a considerable amount of time to generate AEs. As only a limited number of features (determined by the <em id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px6.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">th</em> parameter) are altered, the average perturbation values are very low regardless of the language targeted by the attack. The choice of the <em id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px6.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">th</em> parameter is critical in maximizing the effectiveness of the attack. Based on the conducted experiments, I recommend using a higher value since it produces AEs with less time and can result in larger misclassifications, with just a small amount of additional noise. Therefore, it is reasonable to try values larger than 10.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.SSS0.Px7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are significant differences in the success rate of BoundaryAttack across different datasets, particularly in terms of accuracy. The attack performs significantly better on EmoDB and EMOVO, whereas its success rate is lower on Ravdess. Additionally, when considering male and female samples, there are notable differences in the success rate on EmoDB (higher for males) and EMOVO (higher for females), but not on Ravdess.
<br class="ltx_break">Examining the average perturbation rate, it is noteworthy that although the noise introduced on EmoDB is lower than in the other cases, the attack is still more successful. Conversely, on Ravdess, the perturbation rate is higher, but the accuracy on the adversarial examples is also higher than on the other datasets. There are only slight differences in the perturbation rate between male and female samples, except for Ravdess where the gap is somewhat larger. It is interesting to observe that, in contrast to the previous attacks considered, the average introduced noise is inversely proportional to the misclassification rate in this case.

<br class="ltx_break">Overall, despite being of the black-box type, this technique produces very good AEs for both EmoDB and EMOVO datasets. Specifically, the lower the accuracy, the lower the perturbation. However, for the Ravdess dataset, this attack yields notably inferior results in terms of performance reduction. This observation may indicate that the behavior of this attack is more sensitive to the initial parameter configuration or that it is not well-suited for working with log-Mel spectrograms derived from the English language.</p>
