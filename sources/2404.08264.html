<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Observations with distributed sensors are essential in analyzing a series of human and machine activities (referred to as ’events’ in this paper) in complex and extensive real-world environments. This is because the information obtained from a single sensor is often missing or fragmented in such an environment; observations from multiple locations and modalities should be integrated to analyze events comprehensively. However, a learning method has yet to be established to extract joint representations that effectively combine such distributed observations. Therefore, we propose Guided Masked sELf-Distillation modeling (Guided-MELD) for inter-sensor relationship modeling. The basic idea of Guided-MELD is to learn to supplement the information from the masked sensor with information from other sensors needed to detect the event. Guided-MELD is expected to enable the system to effectively distill the fragmented or redundant target event information obtained by the sensors without being overly dependent on any specific sensors. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in novel tasks of distributed multimedia sensor event analysis, we recorded two new datasets that fit the problem setting: MM-Store <span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span><span id="footnote1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">Sample data for peer review can be accessed here: <span class="ltx_ref ltx_nolink ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter ltx_ref_self">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19cxeWc18ian6TxL14VdwzDk97z9IjBsr?usp=sharing</span>. The full version will be available after acceptance.</span></span></span></span> and MM-Office. These datasets consist of human activities in a convenience store and an office, recorded using distributed cameras and microphones. Experimental results on these datasets show that the proposed Guided-MELD improves event tagging and detection performance and outperforms conventional inter-sensor relationship modeling methods. Furthermore, the proposed method performed robustly even when sensors were reduced.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper addresses a new task: distributed multimedia sensor event analysis (DiMSEA). The input signals in this task are multi-channel and multi-modal sensor signals. As Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Guided Masked Self-Distillation Modeling for Distributed Multimedia Sensor Event Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows, this study focuses particularly on the use of cameras and microphones distributed throughout the room as sensors. This task is broken down into two subtasks: event tagging and event detection. The former identifies the class of events contained in a recording, and the latter, in addition, identifies the onset/offset time of each event. Here, events are defined as a series of human actions or machine movements. For multiple events occurring simultaneously, tagging and detection is performed for each in parallel.
As a practical constraint for annotation cost, this study approaches DiMSEA under the condition that only weak labels without event time annotations are available.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One promising application of this technology is automatically detecting customer behavior in stores. In the store environment, capturing information over the entire area with only a single sensor is difficult due to obstacles such as shelves and acoustic noise. Successful coordination of distributed multimedia sensors is expected to enable the analysis of target events even in such situations. By automatically detecting customer behavior, this system will make it possible to maintain and improve the quality of customer service and security, even if the store has few staff members or is unmanned. Other possible applications include wide-area security systems that detect suspicious persons and signs of violence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> or crime <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, house cleaning systems that automatically disinfect areas touched by people to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, and automatic work support systems for employees in offices. In anticipation of such applications, this study recorded datasets for convenience stores and offices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The primary research question in DiMSEA is how to extract information related to the target event from observations with distributed multimedia sensors. In DiMSEA, distributed sensors are deployed throughout the entire target space to ensure broad coverage. On the other hand, Target events, occur locally in this space. It implies that the observation signals from distributed sensors contain numerous background signals, and the identification of which sensors are observing the target event varies depending on the situation. In addition, the target event is observed fragmentarily by multiple sensors. These fragmented observations include clues about the event that are redundant across sensors, as well as clues unique to a sensor. Previous studies have pointed out that the validity of which viewpoints and modalities of cues depend on the class of events <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Therefore, for a system to effectively utilize the observations of distributed sensors in event analysis, the information of the target event observed fragmentarily among numerous background signals should be extracted by modeling inter-sensor relationships that enable the complementary combination of these observations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although the cooperation of multiple sensors has been utilized in previous studies for action recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, there are limitations in applying these methods to DiMSEA. One established method for coordinating multiple sensors is the conditional random fields (CRF)-based method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which models sensor relationships with a fixed weight matrix. However, such systems fail in model scenarios like DiMSEA, where the useful sensors change depending on the situation. Our previous study addressed this issue by utilizing MultiTrans <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, a Transformer-based system capable of paying attention to the necessary sensors on the basis of input <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, even with this input-dependent attention mechanism, there remains a problem where the trained system erroneously focuses on a few specific sensors due to the training data is practically insufficient for the vast number of situations that can be observed by distributed sensors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the field of representation learning for tasks that analyze signals from single sensors such as images or sound, self-supervised learning methods have gained attention for modeling such signals.
In particular, masked signal modeling (MSM) has been successfully utilized for representation learning of a wide range of modalities, including image, audio, acoustic, and language <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Although no prior work that utilizes MSM to model inter-sensor relationships found, its ability to model the properties of signals well, regardless of modality, would be promising for DiMSEA.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, it is reported that MSM-based representation learning is not robust for background signal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. In other words, MSM does not distinguish whether the input signal is an object of interest. This is a fatal drawback in modeling the distributed sensor signals that contain many background.
Indeed, in our preliminary investigations, a naive adaptation of MSM fails to learn a joint representation of distributed multimedia sensors (this will be discussed in Sec. <a href="#S6.SS5" title="VI-E Results with MM-Store dataset ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Guided Masked Self-Distillation Modeling for Distributed Multimedia Sensor Event Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-E</span></span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We propose Guided Masked sELf-Distillation modeling (Guided-MELD) to make distributed sensors cooperate effectively.
Guided-MELD extracts a joint representation that distills information relevant to target events while excluding disturbing background. The key of Guided-MELD are twofold. First, it ensures that embeddings extracted from any subset of distributed sensor systems are as consistent as possible. It enables the system to extract the maximum possible information regardless of the specific sensors used. The second point is to extract sufficient information about the target event in the embedding. A naive adaptation of MSM to distributed sensor systems does not differentiate between background and the intended event, resulting in embeddings with excessive background information. This concept is implemented by simultaneous learning of the sensor-masking independent embedding extraction and downstream tasks. Here, the learning of the downstream task acts as a GUIDE to ensure that the embedding contains sufficient information of the event.</p>

<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To validate the proposed method in the DiMSEA, we recorded new datasets: MM-Store and MM-Office. Our datasets record human activity with multi-channel cameras and microphones distributed in convenience store and office environments. This concept differs from conventional multi-sensor datasets: datasets with non-distributed multi-view sensors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> or multi-modal datasets based on single point observations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. The experimental results on these datasets show that introducing Guided-MELD significantly improves the performance of DiMSEA, outperforming existing inter-sensor relationship modeling methods. It also performed robustly when reducing the number of sensors.</p>

<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">It should be noted that a part of this paper extends <span id="S1.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">our conference paper</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. The primary connections between the conference paper and this paper are as follows: (1) MultiTrans, the primary contribution of <span id="S1.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">our conference paper</span>, serves as the encoder for the Guided-MELD that is newly proposed in this paper. The Guided-MELD is independently formulated as described in Sec.IV-B, thus representing a distinct contribution. Within this context, MultiTrans is clearly defined as a conventional method. As Sec. VI experimentally shows that Guided-MELD considerably improves the performance of DiMSEA beyond what MultiTrans achieves alone. (2) MM-Office has already been released in the <span id="S1.p9.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">our conference paper</span> among the two datasets we designed. The newly released MM-Store deals with a larger environment and more complex obstacles. To capture this environment, 1.5 times more sensors are deployed, creating a scenario better suited for DiMSEA.</p>

Although MHSA was originally proposed for natural language processing (NPL), it has been reported that by using joint sequences from two modalities as input (e.g., video and word or image and LiDAR image), the relationship between them can be extracted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Such representation learning using the online and target networks was first proposed in image modeling methods based on data augmentation invariance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. The difference between M2D and these methods is that signal modeling is based on masking or a combination of various data augmentation. Masking-based modeling overcomes the disadvantage that different choices of data augmentation methods can result in performance differences. Another promising MSM method is the masked auto-encoder (MAE), which takes a masked signal as input and performs representation learning by means of a task that reconstructs the input itself <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While these MSM methods have been useful for modeling signals observed by a single sensor, modeling the relationship of signals across multiple sensors, which is the subject of this paper, has yet to be explored. Data augmentation methods are also difficult to use for the axes of a sensor series, i.e., to produce data captured by different locations and types of sensors. Therefore, modeling methods based on data augmentation universality cannot be used either. In contrast, modeling via reconstructing masked information in latent space, as used in M2D, is compatible with our problem setting.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We aim to detect human behavior in extensive and complex environments like stores. For this purpose, multiple sensors need to be used for two reasons. First, in complex environments, information from a single sensor is fragmentary, necessitating cooperation among multiple sensors to identify events. Second, to cover extensive areas, the cooperation of multiple sensors is also required. Therefore, for our purpose, it is essential to utilize an integrated distributed sensor system, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-C Masked signal modeling based representation learning ‣ II Related Studies ‣ Guided Masked Self-Distillation Modeling for Distributed Multimedia Sensor Event Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (C), where each sensor covers different areas with partially overlapping coverage. Distributed multimedia sensor event analysis (DiMSEA) is a task we have newly designed to analyze events in extensive and complex environments by coordinating such a distributed sensor system.</p>

(A) does not include background sensors, and each sensor provides redundant or unique information. (B) consists mostly of background sensors, with one or a few providing unique information about the event. The problem setting for DiMSEA (C) includes all cases above. This sensor system includes background and non-background sensors, the number of which varies depending on the situation. Moreover, it contains both redundant and unique information. Therefore, a system for DiMSEA must discern the necessary sensors in accordance with the situation and effectively extract complementary information from the redundant information contained therein. This is a different problem setting from existing multi-sensor-based recognition and detection tasks.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A gap remains between conventional methods of modeling inter-sensor relationships and this desirable encoder. In CRF (Eq. <a href="#S2.E2" title="In II-B Multi-sensor fusion ‣ II Related Studies ‣ Guided Masked Self-Distillation Modeling for Distributed Multimedia Sensor Event Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>), sensor relationships are modeled using a fixed weight matrix. An encoder based on CRF has high weights for averagely valuable sensors. Such a system degrades in performance in the situation where the focused sensor becomes unavailable. Our prior study addresses this issue with the MultiTrans, which can pay attention to necessary sensors depending on input sensor signals. However, even with such input-dependent attention mechanisms, the issue of the over-reliance on specific sensors persists. This can be attributed to the huge variety of situations and sensor combinations in DiMSEA settings, making it challenging to learn these scenarios through training comprehensively. Indeed, our experimental results show that the performance of systems trained with CRF or MultiTrans is significantly degraded by removing only a few sensors.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As an alternative approach for modeling the relationships between sensors, it is conceivable to utilize Masked Signal Modeling (MSM), which has been successful in modeling various modalities of signals for modeling inter-sensor relationships. Although no existing studies exist, one naive implementation could involve masking some sensor signals and training an encoder to restore them. Since this method aims to model inter-sensor relationships by restoring missing sensor information, the encoder learned through this process is expected to depend less on any specific sensor. However, unlike cases where MSM has been successful, the signals from distributed multimedia sensors are mostly background signals. Since MSM itself does not differentiate between background and target events, such a naive adaptation of MSM might not result in embeddings that sufficiently contain information about events. Indeed, previous studies have reported embedding noisy information in MSM, leading to degraded task performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Comparative experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the DiMSEA task. To the best of our knowledge, no existing study has addressed the event analysis task utilizing distributed multimedia sensors. As a similar field, we refer to action recognition with multiple cameras. In particular, we have chosen CRF-based modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and MultiTrans-based modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> as comparison methods, as they are the state-of-the-art methods for inter-view relationship modeling. As baseline methods, we set up a ”Late fusion” method, which uses each sensor independently to fuse only the results, and a ”Concat” method, which simply combines the features obtained from each sensor. In addition to these end-to-end learning-based methods, we employed a method based on MSM as a comparison method. The M2D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> was selected as the state-of-the-art method for MSM in the feature domain.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We adopted the mean average precision (mAP) and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROAUC) as evaluation metrics for the distributed multimedia sensor event analysis task, which are widely adopted in detection tasks. The average precision (AP) is the area under the precision-recall curve. The mAP is obtained as the mean of AP over classes. Note that there are two ways of averaging APs: macro mAP, which calculates mAPs for each class and then averages them, and micro mAP, which averages all classes at once. In this experiment, we adopt macro mAP. Higher values of mAP indicate better performance. The ROAUC is the area under the ROC curve that plots the true positive rate (TPR) versus the false positive rate (FPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>. Higher values of ROAUC indicate better performance. Random inference results in an ROAUC of 0.5. The TP, FP, TN, and FN for calculating these metrics are counted over all test data frame-by-frame for the event detection task and clip-by-clip for the event tagging task.</p>

First in the (a) event tagging task, the proposed method (F) using Guided-MELD significantly outperformed the other methods (A) - (E) in all metrics. In the event tagging task, (B), (C), and (D) fell below the late fusion method (A). A possible reason for this is that this task is an easy problem even for the sensor-independent method (A) because identifying the class of an event only requires a brief capture of the target. Nevertheless, the fact that the proposed method (E) performed the best suggests that it captures events that can only be identified by linking multiple sensors well.</p>

<p id="S6.SS5.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Even in the more challenging task of (b) event detection, the proposed method (F) with Guided-MELD significantly outperformed the other methods (A)-(E) in terms of all metrics. In contrast to the event tagging task, late fusion (A) scored the worst, indicating that the inter-sensor relationship is more important to consider in the event detection task. It is considered that since identifying an event’s onset/offset time requires constant knowledge of the target’s behavior, it is difficult without cooperation among sensors. Multiple-sensor-based methods (B), (C), and (D) gradually improves the best scores of mAP and ROAUC compared with a method without sensor cooperation (A), but the average scores are comparable. The proposed method (F) outperforms (A) in terms of average and maximum scores, indicating that the inter-sensor relationship modeling with Guided-MELD effectively detects events in ever-changing situations.</p>

<div id="S6.SS5.SSS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS5.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Method (E) achieves moderately successful (a) event tagging and (b) event detection performance, despite not using event labels in the training of its encoder. This suggests that the extension to the distributed sensor of MSM is beneficial in extracting embeddings for event detection. However, it has lower performance than all other methods. This is likely because the distributed sensor observations contain numerous backgrounds, and M2D embeds them in the latent space without distinguishing between them.</p>

This indicates that sensor-masking Eq. <a href="#S4.E14" title="In IV-C Implementation for DiMSEA ‣ IV Guided Masked self-distillation modeling (Guided-MELD) ‣ Guided Masked Self-Distillation Modeling for Distributed Multimedia Sensor Event Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">14</span></a> alone does not improve performance due to data augmentation effects. This result leads to a different conclusion from the fact that random masking for images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>, <a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite> or audio <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite> are also effective as data augmentation methods. From these results, in Guided-MELD, compensating for masked sensor information, rather than masking itself, plays an important role in modeling inter-sensor relationships. The (a) event tagging and (b) detection scores of (H) show a significant decrease in performance compared with (F) due to replacing the Multitrans with the CRF. This result indicates that a multi-sensor fusion mechanism for Guided-MELD needs a framework that can model changes in inter-sensor relationships depending on the situation, as MultiTrans does.</p>

The proposed method (F) achieved a higher score than comparison methods in all sensor combinations. While method (A) demonstrates robustness to sensor reduction, its median performance consistently falls below that of the proposed method (F). Methods (B), (C), and (D) exhibit significant performance degradation with the reduction of certain sensor combinations (such as Cameras 0 and 1). This indicates these systems depend on a few sensors and fail to adequately capture event-related information upon their loss. Method (E) shows less performance degradation due to sensor reduction than methods (B), (C), and (D). This suggests the successful extraction of embeddings through MSM-based representation learning that is as invariant as possible to sensor reduction. However, as with the full-sensor case, median performance is consistently low. These results indicate that Guided-MELD is more effective at compensating for reduced sensor coverage through the collaboration of multiple sensors than the alternative methods.</p>

<p id="S6.SS5.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the proposed method (F), the maximum performance in each sensor number condition is almost constant. At the same time, in (A) to (D), there are combinations where the accuracy improves slightly with the reduction of sensors. One possible reason for this is that methods (A) to (D) do not fully utilize the information from all sensors, and event detection is hindered by redundant sensor information. In Guided-MELD, thanks to the joint optimization of Eq. <a href="#S4.E11" title="In IV-B General formulation of Guided-MELD ‣ IV Guided Masked self-distillation modeling (Guided-MELD) ‣ Guided Masked Self-Distillation Modeling for Distributed Multimedia Sensor Event Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> and Eq. <a href="#S4.E12" title="In IV-B General formulation of Guided-MELD ‣ IV Guided Masked self-distillation modeling (Guided-MELD) ‣ Guided Masked Self-Distillation Modeling for Distributed Multimedia Sensor Event Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>), only the sensor information useful for event analysis can be extracted. Therefore, these results indicate that the proposed method eliminates the negative effects of redundant sensors.</p>

<div id="S6.SS5.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS5.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This result offers promising real-world applications. For example, in the application of automatic detection of customer behavior in convenience stores that we focus on, it is desirable to use the same system in multiple stores. However, installing sensors at the same location in all stores is difficult because of the restrictions in each store. Even in this case, if the system is robust against sensor defects, it would be possible to train the system once with a sufficient amount of distributed sensors and then throttle back to the required amount for each store. Another point of view is the robustness to sensor failure. If the sensor fails, the cost of maintaining the system can be reduced if detection performance is maintained at a high level.</p>

These results show that Guided-MELD effectively linked distributed multimedia sensors to identify events in convenience store and office environments. Furthermore, the proposed method performed more robustly than the comparison methods when sensors were reduced. The robustness of the proposed method of sensor reduction offers high utility in practical applications, such as reduced sensor maintenance costs and high flexibility in sensor placement.</p>
