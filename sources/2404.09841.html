<p id="id14.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper describes AssemblyAI’s industrial-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, designed to meet the requirements of large-scale, multilingual ASR serving various application needs. Our system leverages a diverse training dataset comprising unsupervised (12.5M hours), supervised (188k hours), and pseudo-labeled (1.6M hours) data across four languages. We provide a detailed description of our model architecture, consisting of a full-context 600M-parameter Conformer encoder pre-trained with BEST-RQ and an RNN-T decoder fine-tuned jointly with the encoder. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates competitive word error rates (WERs) against larger and more computationally expensive models, such as Whisper large and Canary-1B. Furthermore, our architectural choices yield several key advantages, including an improved code-switching capability, a 5x inference speedup compared to an optimized Whisper baseline, a 30% reduction in hallucination rate on speech data, and a 90% reduction in ambient noise compared to Whisper, along with significantly improved time-stamp accuracy.
Throughout this work, we adopt a system-centric approach to analyzing various aspects of fully-fledged ASR models to gain practically relevant insights useful for real-world services operating at scale.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the past decade, both the research community and the industry have achieved unprecedented progress in artificial intelligence (AI). Especially after the invention of the Transformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, technical differences among various AI domains, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer vision (CV), and natural language processing (NLP), have largely diminished. As a result, the pursuit of higher-quality AI models has become largely synonymous with scaling in terms of model size and the amount of training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, while exploration of Transformer variants, such as Conformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, has continued. This principle has been empirically validated across various AI domains. The correlation between data abundance, parameter count, and model performance has been a cornerstone of AI research, driving efforts to amass extensive datasets for training purposes and scale up the training hardware. Importantly, scaling with respect to both the model size and data quantity has resolved issues that smaller models trained on well-organized yet limited datasets have traditionally encountered, including the lack of generalizability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the field of ASR, OpenAI’s Whisper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> has shown the critical impact of data and model scaling. Whisper models are based on a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, each having a different number of parameters. All models are trained on 680k hours of transcribed speech in multiple languages. The largest model demonstrated industry-leading (at the time of publication of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>) English ASR performance across various test sets while exhibiting strong multilingual ASR and translation capabilities. Following this seminal work, multiple papers have been published describing full-fledged ASR systems, including Open Whisper-Style Speech Models (OWSM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, Universal Speech Model (USM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, SeamlessM4T <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and Canary-1B <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Notably, all these models are multilingual by design.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This trend gives rise to the need for a new approach to understanding an ASR system in its entirety. In this approach, one first builds a full-blown ASR system with model architectures and training procedures of interest by using an industry-scale training dataset, and subsequently analyzes the behavior of the system from various viewpoints. This is in contrast to a more traditional reductionist approach where one concentrates on studying a single particular aspect (such as a model architecture or a training algorithm) while normalizing all other variables. Considering that the goal of ASR is to work reliably out of the box under various conditions, we believe the system-centric approach is a valid methodology when one wants to obtain practically relevant insights. It would also shed light on certain aspects that have received less attention thus far, including ASR hallucinations and code-switching, which are traits that Whisper is known to exhibit empirically.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">With this perspective in mind, in this paper, we build multilingual ASR models using 12.5M hours of pre-training audio and a 1.8M-hour fine-tuning speech dataset.
Reflecting our own needs, we focus on a set of high-resource languages—English, Spanish, German, and French.
For model creation, we employ a Conformer encoder <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> with a Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) decoder <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> as the model architecture and mostly follow the Google USM paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> for training. Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate that our multilingual models exhibit remarkable robustness and competitive performance with state-of-the-art ASR models such as Whisper large-v3<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">*</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">*</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">*</span><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/1762" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/1762</a></span></span></span> and Canary-1B across languages and test sets, while having around half the parameter count. We analyze various aspects of our models, including code-switching, hallucinations, inference latency, timestamp estimation, and the effect of pre-training. Our analysis reveals that ASR models trained on multilingual corpora exhibit an ability of handling code-switching even though the training dataset did not contain code-switching samples.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This work served as a foundation for building Universal-1, AssemblyAI’s commercial ASR system<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">*</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">*</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">*</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/announcing-universal-1-speech-recognition-model/" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/announcing-universal-1-speech-recognition-model/</a></span></span></span>.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Numerous studies have shown the effectiveness of learning speech representations from speech-only corpora with self-supervised approaches. Since learning to reconstruct audio signals can be challenging, much of the recent research has moved away from auto-encoding approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Instead, a speech encoder can be trained to solve proxy pretext tasks, which helps it obtain rich latent speech representations. The encoder can then be further fine-tuned in conjunction with a decoder with an ASR loss.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Wav2vec 2.0 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is trained to solve a contrastive task, where it learns to distinguish between positive and distractor samples, which are obtained after encoding, masking and quantizing different time slices within an utterance. HuBERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> uses a BERT-like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> masked prediction loss on k-means-clustered audio features. BEST-RQ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, a method which we adopt in this paper, also uses a masked BERT-style loss. However, it obtains the discrete target labels using frozen random projections and codebooks, thus bypassing the need for elaborate representation learning of discrete prediction targets. These studies and others have shown how pre-training with self-supervised learning (SSL) can reduce the need for large amounts of supervised data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are other approaches to scaling the training data, and these studies have also shown that sheer scaling of the training data as well as the model size remains an effective way for improving ASR performance.
One established approach is
using pseudo-labels, as in a noisy-student training setting. It was shown that training using pseudo-labels could result in better performance than training with human labels alone <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
Our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> also showed the benefits of scaling, which we expand upon in this paper with larger models trained on more data. An alternative approach is using weakly supervised data, as with Whisper.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Thanks to the increased training data quantities and the training algorithms for effectively utilizing them, including SSL, it is becoming possible to train a unified multilingual model encompassing a number of languages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">End-to-end ASR models are trained to accurately output token sequences, without explicit loss terms for word-level timestamps. Nevertheless, studies have shown that RNN-T and CTC losses, which explore all possible monotonic alignments between the audio and the target transcripts, can learn time alignments as a side effect <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. We experimentally demonstrate that a scaled up bidirectional encoder pre-trained with BEST-RQ and fine-tuned with the RNN-T loss yields accurate word-level timestamp estimates. On the other hand, encoder-decoder models such as Whisper large-v3 and Canary-1B have no notion of blank tokens or alignment-based loss functions. Therefore, additional models are often used to perform forced alignment and obtain the word-level timestamps, as with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhao et al. [<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>], Bain et al. [<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a broader AI context, there are various studies investigating the hallucination problem of large language models and other generative models. See, for example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Ji et al. [<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> for an overview. Recently, this problem has started gaining attention in ASR, becoming increasingly noticeable as ASR models grow in scale <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Previous investigations have attempted to illustrate hallucination examples qualitatively. In this paper, we introduce new hallucination metrics to quantitatively analyze the ASR hallucination problem for our RNN-T-based model as well as Whisper and Canary-1B, both of which are based on encoder-decoder models.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To train an ASR model end-to-end, including a decoder, supervised data with reference transcriptions are indispensable. We have purchased and curated our supervised dataset from various sources, including publicly accessible sources with permissive licensing terms and our partners, among others. Despite the expectation that reference transcriptions are 100% accurate, we have found that this is not always the case. Therefore, we have developed a filtering scheme for quality control that compares the reference transcriptions against ASR outputs for verification. This quality control pipeline employs several heuristics using various metrics, including WER, consecutive deletion errors, and language detection consistency. After the quality control filtering, our supervised dataset amounts to approximately 188k hours.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While our supervised dataset may be comparable to or exceed the training data typically used in published studies in terms of quantity, it still does not seem to reflect the variability of real-world speech. To bridge the gap between the quantity of supervised data and the amount ideally required, we also employ a pseudo-labeling approach, in which we generate reference transcriptions with an existing, well-trained ASR model. The effectiveness of pseudo-labeling has been demonstrated previously <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, including in our past Conformer-1 project <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since ASR models generate transcription errors, we utilize two ASR models and discard any samples where the two machine transcriptions disagree to the extent that the WER between them exceeds 20%. This step helps prevent the model from replicating error patterns of the existing ASR models to some extent. This yields 1.62M hours of pseudo-labeled data. All transcribed samples are segmented to 30 seconds or shorter for training.</p>

whether to start a masking region is determined for each frame independently with a fixed masking probability.
Our implementation guarantees static shapes, enabling more efficient implementation on TPUs. In our preliminary experiments, the two masking strategies showed almost the same convergence behaviors.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">During the fine-tuning stage,
the BEST-RQ pre-trained encoder is combined with a randomly-initialized CTC or RNN-T decoder to form an end-to-end ASR model. At the start of fine-tuning, gradients are noisy due to the randomly initialized decoder. To prevent catastrophic forgetting of the pre-trained encoder weights, we use
a lower peak learning rate and longer warm-up period for the encoder, as shown in <a href="#S3.T2" title="In 3.3.1 Pre-training ‣ 3.3 Training method ‣ 3 Universal-1 ‣ Anatomy of Industrial Scale Multilingual ASR" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. We used float32 precision for fine-tuning, as bfloat16 caused loss spikes. Training is terminated after 75k steps.
Based on preliminary experiments and educated guesses about the data quality and diversity, we sampled 1.5 times more often from the supervised dataset than from the pseudo-labeled dataset when creating mini-batches.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Long-form audio input is usually split into shorter chunks. This is performed to reduce the mismatch between the audio length to be decoded and those encountered by the model during training, where the training-time audio length is typically in the order of tens of seconds. Segmentation also helps reduce inference time when the computational complexity of the forward pass grows super-linearly, which is the case with vanilla Transformer models. For instance, Whisper and its follow-up models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> sequentially transcribe 30-second audio chunks from the beginning of the input audio by shifting the 30-second window based on predicted timestamps.</p>

<div id="S3.SS4.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our approach is to process individual audio chunks in parallel to optimize for reducing inference latency, i.e., turnaround time, for generating the output transcription for the entire audio. We split the input audio in a way that makes each chunk as long as possible within the maximum input length the model has been trained for during both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages, i.e., 32 seconds. We implement this by leveraging voice activity detection (VAD) to prevent the chunk boundary from occurring in the middle of a word. Specifically, a new chunk is created when a predefined minimum length is exceeded, and the VAD detects consecutive silence of 0.1 seconds or longer. The produced audio chunks are finally converted to log-mel spectrograms, padded to 32 seconds, and batched together up to a predefined maximum batch size. For VAD, we utilize WebRTC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The batched audio frames from the segmentation stage are passed through the Conformer encoder of our model to obtain the temporally downsampled, encoded feature frames. These are passed to a batched greedy RNN-T decoding routine, which iteratively generates the output tokens and token-level timestamps for the entire batch in parallel. We limit the decoder to emit up to 5 tokens per feature frame. The timestamps produced at this stage are with respect to each chunk’s local reference frame, i.e., in the range from 0 to 32 seconds.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we take the output transcriptions and timestamps from all batches and concatenate them to generate a single output. This involves concatenating the individual transcriptions and applying per-chunk offsets to the predicted timestamps. That is, we convert the timestamp values from a local (i.e., within-chunk) time scale to a global one. Additional post-processing steps are applied, including timestamp bias correction (<a href="#S4.SS7" title="4.7 Timestamp estimation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Anatomy of Industrial Scale Multilingual ASR" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Section</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.7</span></a>) and text formatting (<a href="#A3" title="Appendix C Text formatting ‣ Anatomy of Industrial Scale Multilingual ASR" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Appendix</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One emergent capability in multilingual ASR models is the ability to handle code-switching speech. Code-switching occurs when a speaker switches back and forth between two or more languages in a single conversation, sometimes even within a single sentence. We have observed that our model, trained on multilingual training data using a multilingual tokenizer, exhibits the ability to handle code-switching speech to a certain extent. In this section, we explore this aspect by comparing our model with Whisper and Canary-1B, which also use multilingual tokenizers and are trained on multilingual data.</p>

We can observe that our model handled the code-switching samples quite effectively compared to the other two models, irrespective of their language-code configurations, achieving the lowest WER by substantial margins. Upon manual inspection, we found that other models occasionally introduced disruptive artifacts, which seem to be the result of conditioning decoding on one language token or training for multiple tasks. Sometimes, these artifacts manifest themselves as significant deletion errors or translations, even though we specified the task as transcription. We hypothesize that the stability of our model with respect to code-switching can be attributed to the balanced diversity of our training datasets and the single-task nature of our training setup.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To investigate inference latency and throughput, we compared our Universal-1 model with Whisper large-v3 and Canary-1B. The latency of an ASR system is quantified using Real Time Factor (RTF), defined as the ratio of the aggregate wall clock time to process an entire dataset to the cumulative duration of the audio files within the dataset. In addition to the overall RTF analysis, we include detailed measurements of the inference times for both the encoder and decoder components. We utilized two distinct datasets, LibriSpeech test-other and TED-LIUM3, which serve as proxies for short-form and long-form audio benchmarking, respectively. The evaluation was conducted on an Nvidia T4 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), equipped with 16 Gigabytes (GB) of Video Random Access Memory (VRAM).</p>

For the short-form audio clips, our model achieved 43% and 60% relative speed-up compared to Whisper large-v3 and Canary-1B, respectively. These speed gains can be attributed to the smaller parameter count, the use of chunk-wise attention in the encoder, and the relative compactness of a Transducer decoder compared to Transformer decoders.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The inference efficiency of Universal-1 is further enhanced when transcribing long-form audio content. Even without batched inference, we observed 68% and 87% relative RTF reduction compared to Whisper large-v3 and Canary-1B, respectively. With batched inference, our model achieved a 5-fold RTF reduction in comparison to Whisper large-v3. The substantial RTF gain can be primarily attributed to the improved decoder speed, which greatly benefited from the parallelized inference. Notably, we observed an increase in encoder RTF with batched inference for both the Whisper large-v3 and Universal-1 models. We attribute this phenomenon to a computational bottleneck with the the T4 GPU hardware used in this experiment.</p>

<p id="S4.SS6.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the ongoing amalgamation of deep learning (DL) methods for audio and text processing, the phenomenon of hallucinations, originally discovered in NLP tasks, has become increasingly more common in the ASR field. Anecdotally, the Whisper large-v3 model has particularly been demonstrated to suffer from an increased propensity for hallucinations compared to its predecessors, despite substantial improvements in WER<span id="footnote4" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">*</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">*</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">*</span><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/1762#discussioncomment-7557044" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/1762#discussioncomment-7557044</a></span></span></span>. However, there have been limited attempts thus far to study this emerging behaviour of modern ASR systems quantitatively. In this section, we propose evaluation metrics for quantitative analysis of ASR models with respect to their susceptibility to hallucinations.</p>

<div id="S4.SS6.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS6.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of ASR, hallucinations occur when the ASR model continuously produces words that are not grounded in the input audio or when it disregards long spoken segments. They can be measured by the number of consecutive transcription errors that the model makes in comparison to the reference transcripts. Following the edit operation concept in edit distance, such errors can be further divided into subgroups such as <span id="S4.SS6.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fabrication</span> errors consisting of consecutive insertions or substitutions, and <span id="S4.SS6.SSS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">omission</span> errors consisting of consecutive deletions. Based on this classification of consecutive errors, we define the corresponding consecutive error rates for a detailed analysis of hallucinations as follows:</p>

<p id="S4.SS6.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We would attribute the reduced propensity for hallucinations of Universal-1 to the use of a Transducer-based model architecture, as opposed to an encoder-decoder architecture employed by Whisper and Canary-1B, and to our extensive data filtering pipelines for removing training samples with low-quality reference transcriptions. As discussed before in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, discriminative sequence models have different levels of susceptibility to the label bias problem, which is characterized by the overreliance on previously emitted labels while disregarding new evidence. We hypothesize that the hallucination problem in ASR is partly caused by label bias. Thus, RNN-T could be less susceptible to the aforementioned problem, since its auto-regressive decoder is smaller than in encoder-decoder models.</p>

Specifically, we obtained 200 audio samples from each dataset, while excluding any sound categories that might contain human speech. The filtering was performed based on the ontology provided by each dataset, removing categories like <em id="S4.SS6.SSS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">singing</em> or <em id="S4.SS6.SSS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">conversation</em>.

In comparison, our model produced a blank output around 90% of the time. For Canary-1B, most of the generated text consisted of short words like “and”, while Whisper would often output strings of repeated or unintelligible special symbols. The most severe cases—and the hardest ones to filter out with post-processing—are those where the models output long plausible sequences, which Whisper large-v3 suffered from most frequently. Our model’s faulty outputs tended to be short, as shown in the table.</p>

To create reference word-level timestamps for the test audio files, we performed forced alignment with the Montreal Forced Aligner toolkit <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> on the audio signal and the reference transcription.

For each x-axis value, the corresponding y-axis value shows the percentage of words whose estimated timestamp falls within this threshold when compared to the reference timestamp. A curve that approaches the upper-left corner indicates a model with more accurate timestamp estimation. Universal-1 model produced more accurate timestamps than Whisper large-v3 by a significant margin. Additionally, we included two powerful open-source models, NeMo’s Parakeet RNN-T and CTC models with 600M parameters. The results highlight the advantage of RNN-T in terms of timestamp estimation, while our model still substantially outperformed Parakeet RNN-T.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The superior performance achieved by our model is intriguing because an RNN-T loss does not explicitly include any terms related to the accuracy of audio-to-token alignments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, a few observations can be made to describe this unexpected effectiveness. First, the use of bidirectional context by the encoder is essential. In our other experiments using a streaming Conformer encoder, the timestamp prediction accuracy dropped drastically, with significant delays compared to the reference timestamps. In the streaming scenario, an additional mechanism, such as the one proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhao et al. [<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, is necessary to compensate for the delays. Second, greedy decoding may be more beneficial for timestamp accuracy than beam search, which optimizes for transcription accuracy. Finally, the use of chunk-wise attention in the encoder may also help constrain the audio-to-token alignment space. Further research into these aspects will allow us to draw more decisive conclusions.</p>

To do so, we trained CTC models starting from different pre-training checkpoints. For efficiency in the investigation, for each pre-trained checkpoint, we used the first 12 layers of the encoder, added a CTC decoder on top, and fine-tuned the model for 10k steps to assess performance and convergence speed. Thus, each model size was approximately 300M parameters.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this comprehensive study, we have presented Universal-1, a highly capable multilingual ASR system developed for English, Spanish, German, and French. Our investigation has revealed that the combination of a vast pre-training dataset, meticulously curated fine-tuning corpora, and the employment of a Conformer RNN-T model architecture results in remarkably robust performance across languages and test sets while achieving significantly faster inference than state-of-the-art open-source models.
This achievement underscores the effectiveness of scaling in ASR systems, aligning with the prevailing trend in AI research that emphasizes the importance of the quality and volume of the training data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, our analysis extends beyond a WER comparison, shedding light on practically relevant aspects, such as code-switching, resistance to hallucinations, timestamp estimation, and inference latency, as well as the impact of pre-training on fine-tuning efficiency. The insights derived from these observations could offer the speech community a deeper understanding of the nuanced dynamics within ASR systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have emphasized a holistic, system-centric approach to the design and analysis of ASR systems. Rather than isolating individual components and investigating them by normalizing other variables, our methodology considers the ASR system in its entirety, focusing on real world use cases and aiming to make more nuanced and practically relevant observations. We believe this perspective is crucial for advancing the field, as the ASR technology matures and finds more applications in the real world.
Future research should aim to build publicly accessible, comprehensive benchmarks covering the aspects that we discussed in this paper as well as other critical aspects, such as measuring proper noun recognition.</p>

<div id="A3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The output from an ASR system typically consists of a sequence of words with no formatting (e.g., <span id="A3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how much is the new phone you got i think something around five hundred dollars</span>). Even when the ASR output text represents the spoken words accurately, the absence of proper punctuation, truecasing, and other formatting artifacts makes the text challenging for humans to read. Therefore, in real-world applications, we apply a post-processing step to convert the ASR output into a formatted version that is more suitable for human readers (e.g., <span id="A3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How much is the new phone you got?
