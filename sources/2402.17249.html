<p id="id13.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id13.id1.1" class="ltx_text">The ever-evolving ways attacker continues to improve their phishing techniques to bypass existing state-of-the-art phishing detection methods pose a mountain of challenges to researchers in both industry and academia research due to the inability of current approaches to detect complex phishing attack. Thus, current anti-phishing methods remain vulnerable to complex phishing because of the increasingly sophistication tactics adopted by attacker coupled with the rate at which new tactics are being developed to evade detection. In this research, we proposed an adaptable framework that combines Deep learning and Randon Forest to read images, synthesize speech from deep-fake videos, and natural language processing at various predictions layered to significantly increase the performance of machine learning models for phishing attack detection.
To validate both the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed framework in overcoming limitations in current approaches and its ability to detect complex phishing site, we created 4 categories of phishing sites and uploaded them to a secure server with a compromised DNS on a friendly URL; the first was a text-only phishing site, image-only phishing site, video-only phishing site, and a phishing site combining all the features. We use SEO friendly URLs, and hacked legitimate DNS on the text-only phishing site, so that they can evade detection at 1<sup id="id13.id1.1.1" class="ltx_sup">st</sup> layer until the 4<sup id="id13.id1.1.2" class="ltx_sup">th</sup> layer of the framework where they were detected, we also created phishing sites where text are in image only format, text-only, and video only format using deep-fake video to test the adaptability of our proposed framework to different scenarios of a sophisticated or complex phishing site, our proposed framework successfully overcome limitations in existing approaches, significantly improve phishing attack detection, and successfully detect complex phishing webpages with multi-dimensional deep-fake videos, images, and texts.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The insufficiency of traditional phishing detection methods such as user education <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and rule-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> against sophisticated phishing attack techniques has led researchers to exploration of possible AI-based solutions. While several machine learning-based models have been proposed, the fact that attackers use advanced innovative methods that are continuously changing to carry out phishing attacks renders previously proposed machine learning models ineffective against sophisticated attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Although tools like PhishTank, and OpenPhish were created for the effective detection of malicious Uniform Resource Locator (URL) the rate at which malicious websites are created coupled with the sophistication of the deception method easily overwhelm the system as phishing sites are being created every 11 seconds <a target="_blank" href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/phishing-statistics/" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">according to dataprot 2023 phishing statistic report</a>.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One of the common problems with the current ML model is the quality of the dataset used for the training model which has a significant impact on both the accuracy and overall performance of the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. These data do not reflect the ever-changing strategies through which attackers continue to fool existing machine learning-based models to evade detection. In addition, the balancing problem between human factors and model accuracy causes illegal flagging of newly registered legitimate websites due to weak domain authority. Phishing websites have a short life span as they are quickly taken down before detection and another one is created, It is the rate at which an existing phishing website is taken down after launching a campaign and the immediate creation of a new phishing website <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> to begin another campaign coupled with the ever-changing but sophisticated techniques that makes the problem very potent and significant.</p>

It is worth noting that past research work on phishing attack detection had been largely based on approaches, classification, etc. RASHA ZIENI et al.. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> focus their review on list-based, similarity-based, and machine learning-based categories of approaches for phishing detection to identify pending research gap, Angad et al.. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> focus theirs on the advantages and limitations of existing approaches to phishing detection, while also using discussion of related application scenarios as guidance to propose a new method of anti-phishing detection, Yifei Wang <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> categorizes widely used phishing detection methods into seven categories and summarizes them. All previously proposed models, approaches, and frameworks have common limitation, there limitation was that they are either text-based or URL-based which makes it difficult for them to detect complex phishing attack where the attacker uses deep-fake videos, deep-fake images, textual-based images, or combination of any with traditional textual content.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this research, we first reviewed some of the most recent works on phishing detection, and state-of-the-art algorithms from the past 5 years to investigate the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning classifiers for phishing detection tasks, before proposing a multi-layered adaptive framework that uses computer vision to read images on a phishing webpage, and condense videos from a webpage to audio before synthesizing the speech into a condensed text to increase detection of a phishing attack. We use a combination of random forest algorithm and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) at different layers of the framework for effective coordination. The contributions of our research include the proposal of an adaptive multi-layered framework that uses computer vision to read graphic images, synthesize speech from uploaded videos, and natural language processing at various predictions layered to significantly increase the performance of machine learning-based models for phishing detection. Our artifacts which consist of source code, dataset, images, videos, and audio files for this research had been uploaded to a public GitHub repository for reproducibility of our research.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For this research, We opted for Long Short-Term Memory a variant of recurrent neural network (RNN) because of its effective solution to vanishing and exploding gradients which are Long-term dependency problems in Recurrent Neural Networks. The most important functioning part of an LSTM network is the cell state which serves as a memory to the network thereby enabling it to remember the past. Hence their suitability for capturing long-term dependencies and sequence prediction problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. LSTM network has an input gate, a forget gate, and an output gate which are sigmoid activation functions with an output value of 0 or 1.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the effect of phishing attack, several methods, frameworks had been proposed for phishing attack detection but with varying results, these methods are classified based on their different approaches which we classified as Non-Machine Learning, machine learning (Bayesian-based, non-Bayesian-based) and deep learning-based. As attackers continue to navigate potential vulnerabilities to existing phishing detection solution, they are begining to rely on several images and uploaded videos rather than traditional text to enable them to evade detection, the inability of existing machine learning-based model to detect such phishing site is a peculiar limitation to existing AI-based solution. Palla Yaswanth and V. Nagaraju <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> used Huang and Premaratne data from Kaggle repository with an equal number of phishing and legitimate datasets for novel network of phishing predictions with an accuracy of 95% for naive Bayes and 94.67% for random forest based on parameter turning. During the comparison of the performances of naive Bayes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and random forest for detection of phishing sites in a network, there was no testing of the model against sophisticated form of phishing attack and causes of the 5% failure rate of naive bayes in the research.</p>

The proposed hybrid model resulted in an accuracy of 98.2% by using the only attribute properties of the uniform resource locator. The sole reliance on the attribute of the URL makes this approach extremely vulnerable to URL manipulations as any attacker with little experience in web technology can use a malicious webpage with a friendly URL to fool the model.</p>

The implementation of each classifiers resulted in the highest accuracy of 98.2% for naive Bayes, albeit the use an imbalance dataset comprising 87% ham and 13% spam for the research surely indicate biased in the proposed model, and the problem of Bayesian poisoning was not addressed in the proposed model.</p>

By training the proposed model with a relatively balanced dataset of 7000 records in which 54% are malicious and 46% are benign leading to an accuracy of 99.1%. By using a combination of content extraction and URL analysis, we believed the proposed model would not be vulnerable to malicious URLs in the sense that even if the attacker tried to use a friendly URL to deceive the model, that the model does not rely on the properties of URL alone but also uses background webpage extraction means the proposed model will still be able to classify webpages correctly, albeit an attacker will still be able to use Bayesian poisoning.</p>

The behind-the-scenes mode of web scrapping the HTML content protects the server and the network from potential drive-by attacks that might originate from the phishing site. All the syntax of HTML mark-up language was removed From the extracted HTML by REGEX as we needed only the content within the opening and closing of the body tag which is the section being served by web server to potential victims while on a phishing website, this step securely brings whatever content (textual, videos, or images) that will be served to potential victim into the framework for series of processing, and this effectively ensure that they cannot evade detection.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we wrote an algorithm to iterate through every filtered word in the sentence, returning only the list of words with any image extension. The fact that the webpage was webs crapped means our program automatically returns a list of the full path of those images from the web server where they are hosted. The returned list is further iterated and passed through an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library which uses computer vision to read content of each images into a raw text message and forward it to the next layer for further processing.</p>

To validate both the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed framework in overcoming such limitations, we created 4 categories of phishing sites and uploaded them to a secure server with a compromised DNS on a friendly URL; the first was a text-only phishing site, image-only phishing site, video-only phishing site, and a phishing site combining all the features.
We use friendly URLs, and hacked legitimate DNS on the text-only phishing site, so that they can evade detection at layer 1 until the 4th layer where it will be detected, while we created phishing sites containing each image-only, text-only, and a combination of both to test the adaptability of the framework to different scenarios of a phishing site.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this research, we proposed a multi-layer adaptive framework that uses the computer vision capability of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read images on live phishing sites to text, and synthesize speech from uploaded deep-fake videos, while using Random Forest, and LSTM network, along with web scrapped text at various predictions layered of the framework to significantly improve the detection rate and performance of AI-based models for phishing detection.

</h2>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We used Mendeley and Kaggle phishing datasets which are URL-based and Text-based respectively. image-based and video-based phishing datasets are not publicly available because they are newly adopted forms of phishing websites to evade detection, we simulated them to get the data internally generated for this research especially with regard to deep-fake videos, hence getting publicly available image-based or Video-based phishing datasets will significantly help the research community in this.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The other research direction we will point at is the computational aspect during training. The proposed framework uses Random Forest and LSTM network at Layer 1 and Layer 4 respectively. The fact that Random Forest algorithm creates multiple trees each time to combine individual tree decisions for more accurate prediction leads to an increment in computation time, we have to set the random state to zero while changing the maximum depth for optimal hyper-parameter. Apart from the training computation time, there is also the server response time as the framework web scrapped the content behind the scenes thereby protecting the server against potential drive-by attacks. Hence, reducing the server response and computational to fraction of a second is an area open to future research in this domain.
