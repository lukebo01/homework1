<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Emotions are an essential element in verbal communication, so understanding individuals’ affect during a human-robot interaction (HRI) becomes imperative. This paper investigates the application of vision transformer models, namely ViT (Vision Transformers) and BEiT (BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers) pipelines, for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) in HRI. The focus is to generalize the SER models for individual speech characteristics by fine-tuning these models on benchmark datasets and exploiting ensemble methods. For this purpose, we collected audio data from different human subjects having pseudo-naturalistic conversations with the NAO robot. We then fine-tuned our ViT and BEiT-based models and tested these models on unseen speech samples from the participants. In the results, we show that fine-tuning vision transformers on benchmark datasets and and then using either these already fine-tuned models or ensembling ViT/BEiT models gets us the highest classification accuracies per individual when it comes to identifying four primary emotions from their speech: neutral, happy, sad, and angry, as compared to fine-tuning vanilla-ViTs or BEiTs.</p>

To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the earliest in the literature to evaluate vision transformer based models for speech emotion recognition in pseudo-naturalistic verbal communications in HRI. This evaluation of ViT based models has been done for modeling the individual characteristics in SER. This means, given a set of audio clips from an individual with labelled emotions (here neutral, happy, sad, and angry), we can predict the speech emotion of that individual for a different set of sentences spoken during a one-to-one HRI.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The evolution of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has been marked by a continuous exploration of increasingly sophisticated techniques, each building upon the foundations laid by its predecessors. Early research in SER relied heavily on traditional approaches, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and prosodic features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. MFCCs, derived from the human auditory system’s response to sound, capture spectral characteristics crucial for distinguishing various speech sounds, while prosodic features like pitch, intensity, and duration provide insights into the emotional tone of speech. These handcrafted features, though valuable, often struggled to capture the subtle and complex interplay of acoustic cues that contribute to emotional expression.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The advent of deep learning revolutionized the field of SER, offering a powerful framework for automatically learning intricate patterns and representations from raw speech data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), with their multiple layers of interconnected nodes, enabled the extraction of high-level features that better captured the subtle nuances of emotional speech <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, proved adept at modeling the temporal dynamics of speech, crucial for understanding the evolution of emotions over time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), originally designed for image processing, demonstrated their effectiveness in capturing local patterns and spatial dependencies in spectrograms, further enhancing SER performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

This robustness was crucial for a human-robot interaction scenario with robot’s ego noise. Further, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> propose a machine learning pipeline for SER. Their approach involves using personalized and non-personalized features for SER. However, neither of these papers contributes to evaluating transformer-based architectures, which are currently state-of-the-art (SOTA) in numerous fields of study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A number of benchmark datasets have been developed for SER that capture speaker characteristics owing to the number of actors involved for generating the data.

Owing to this large number of datasets, numerous approaches have been proposed in the literature. Even with transformer-based architectures, limited work has been shown in the SER literature. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> show the highest performance on the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> (described more in Section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="III-C Datasets ‣ III Methodology ‣ Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction using Vision Transformers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-C</span></span></a>), using a pre-trained xlsr-Wav2Vec2.0 transformer. A more recent transformer-based approach includes the work by the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> where they used a Whisper-based speech emotion recognition.

Fine-tuning vanilla ViTs and vanilla BEiTs gives us some promising results when compared to the SOTA. For the RAVDESS dataset, we currently achieve SOTA using the vanilla-ViT model, with the highest performance of 97.49% accuracy as compared to the current SOTA, which has a classification accuracy of 86.70% using multimodal data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.

The classification accuracy for the CREMA-D dataset was the highest for the mixed dataset approach (Approach 2) with vanilla-ViTs, which is better than the performance of comparable transformer architectures presented by the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> and other non-transformer-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluated our speech emotion recognition in a pseudo-naturalistic human-robot interaction scenario using our fine-tuned ViTs and BEiTs. Since each participant asked five questions to the robot and responded to those five questions asked by the robot, we have 40 audio clips from each participant. We divided them into train and test datasets such that two sets of questions and answers each participant gave were separated for the test set. So, each participant had three questions and answer sets for train data. Each of those questions and answers was spoken in a way that depicts each of the four primary emotions of the individual. The split of the train and test data for each participant is shown in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction using Vision Transformers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>. Once the audio has been recorded from the participants, we convert the WAV files into spectrograms as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction using Vision Transformers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

Hence, each participant had six audio clips for each emotion for the train set and four for the test set. Owing to the performance of Vision transformers-based approaches from Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction using Vision Transformers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, we used similar approaches to evaluate the use of vision transformers for speech emotion recognition in pseudo-naturalistic human-robot interaction.</p>

It becomes evident that the best performance is obtained when we use two broad approaches. First, when we use ViT<sub id="S4.SS1.p2.2.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S4.SS1.p2.2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mix</span></sub> or BEiT<sub id="S4.SS1.p2.2.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S4.SS1.p2.2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mix</span></sub>. This means that fine-tuning a vision transformer-based model on already existing benchmark datasets like the RAVDESS, TESS, CREMA-D, ESD, and MELD helps in recognizing the individual speech emotion characteristics of an individual speaker. The reason can be seen in Figure <a href="#S4.F3.sf1" title="In Figure 3 ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction using Vision Transformers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3a</span></a> showing the t-sne plots of the vanilla-ViT embeddings. These t-sne plots show the ViT embeddings for each emotion, plotted for all the benchmark datasets and the participants’ data. The overlap between the speech characteristics of speakers from these benchmark datasets and the participants for our human-robot interaction study helped better classify speech emotion compared to vanilla ViTs or vanilla-BEiTs. For some participants, the ensemble models worked better since their speech characteristics didn’t exactly overlap with the benchmark datasets used in this paper. These outliers can be seen from the t-sne plots in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction using Vision Transformers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Fine-tuning Vanilla-ViTs or BEiTs on each participant data for recognizing an individual’s speech emotion had the worst classification accuracies as compared to its other counterparts shown in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction using Vision Transformers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we address the gap in speech emotion recognition for pseudo-naturalistic and personalized verbal HRI. We evaluate the use of vision transformer based models for identifying four primary emotions: neutral, happy, sad, and angry from the speech characteristics of our participants’ data. We do this by first fine-tuning the vision transformer-based models on benchmark datasets. We then use these fine-tuned models to fine-tune them again on participants’ speech data and/or perform ensembling of these models. This helps us choose the best model for each participant, hence contributing towards understanding the emotional speech characteristics of each individual instead of proposing a group model. In addition to creating these personalized speech emotion recognition models, we also evaluate vanilla-ViT and vanilla-BEiTs on benchmark datasets like RAVDESS, TESS, CREMA-D, ESD, and MELD. We observed SOTA performances on some of these benchmark datasets.</p>
