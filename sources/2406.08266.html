<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">It was shown in literature that speech representations extracted by self-supervised pre-trained models exhibit similarities with brain activations of human for speech perception and fine-tuning speech representation models on downstream tasks can further improve the similarity. However, it still remains unclear if this similarity can be used to optimize the pre-trained speech models. In this work, we therefore propose to use the brain activations recorded by fMRI to refine the often-used wav2vec2.0 model by aligning model representations toward human neural responses. Experimental results on SUPERB reveal that this operation is beneficial for several downstream tasks, e.g., speaker verification, automatic speech recognition, intent classification. One can then consider the proposed method as a new alternative to improve self-supervised speech models.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Self-supervised learning has revolutionized the field of speech processing, where the resulting model can extract some efficient, robust and universal features from unlabeled samples through e.g., adversarial learning, clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Given a small amount of labeled data, the model can be fine-tuned to further upgrade the universal features with representation capabilities into exclusive features for downstream tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, contrastive predictive coding (CPC) was proposed, which leverages adversarial learning to learn audio features. Schneider et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> followed this scheme and optimization objectives of CPC and found that using the pre-trained wav2vec model to extract features can effectively improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR). Baevski et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> further proposed a quantization-based wav2vec, followed by a more advanced end-to-end self-supervised model, called wav2vec2.0 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which is shown to be more promising for ASR. HuBERT was then proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which provides a discretized target sequence containing acoustic and semantic information, enabling to learn richer multi-level speech features and resulting in a stronger generalization to various downstream speech processing tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the impressive efficacy of self-supervised speech pre-tained models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, numerous studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> make efforts to establish connections between the general features extracted from these models and the information processing procedures of the human brain's nervous system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. For example, Millet et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> conducted an alignment-matching study using wav2vec2.0 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activity records during speech listening. The result shows a correlation between the speech representation of pre-trained models and brain activations during speech perception. Similarly, Vaidya et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> validated that self-supervised speech models (e.g., APC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, wav2vec, wav2vec2.0, HuBERT) can effectively capture information levels that are related to different stages of human cortical speech processing. Oota et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> then evaluated the performance of different categories of speech models in encoding speech stimuli toward human neural activations. It was further indicated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> that using downstream tasks to fine-tune pre-trained models can improve the neural encoding performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Conversely, it is still unclear whether leveraging neural activations in the human brain can enhance the performance of pre-trained speech models on downstream tasks. For text processing, Toneva et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> suggested that updating a pre-trained language model to better predict the neural responses of human language processing can improve language understanding capacity. Schwartz et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> demonstrated that using brain activity records to fine-tune BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> can enhance the ability to predict brain neural activity during language processing without compromising its performance on downstream tasks. However, there is currently no report on how to optimize the pre-trained speech models via neural encoding for downstream speech tasks. Hence, it is worthwhile to investigate similar approaches for enhancing self-supervised pre-trained speech models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which are thus called <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">neuroscience-driven</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, in this work we make efforts to explore the potential of pre-trained speech models on downstream tasks by incorporating neural activations from human speech perception into model parameters. Specifically, the well-known wav2vec2.0 is selected as the examplary pre-trained speech model without loss of generality. The proposed method refines wav2vec2.0 with brain activations by adding convolutional and linear layers on top of the model. These layers aim to predict brain activations from speech signals, and the parameters of wav2vec2.0 are updated using the L2-regularized mean square error (MSE) loss. Additionally, historical audio information, based on the predictive coding theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, is utilized as the input for prediction. After fine-tuning, the refined model is evaluated using the general speech processing performance benchmark (SUPERB) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. The obtained results verify the efficacy of the proposed method on several downstream tasks.</p>

The Glasser atlas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> is adopted for this purpose, partitioning each hemisphere into 180 ROIs. The selected voxels are from ROIs of the early auditory cortex (EAC), auditory association cortex (AAC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Finally, the pre-processed BOLD signals in each TR are represented by a vector of 5085 dimensions, corresponding to 2468 voxels in the right brain and 2617 voxels in the left brain.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of this work is to construct a neural encoding model by adding additional layers on top of the pre-trained wav2vec2.0, which can predict subject's brain activations given the speech stimulus. Due to the data conditions in Section 2.1, the model output is the 5085-dimensional pre-processed BOLD vector at each TR, and the model input comprises 16kHz speech waveforms corresponding to the current and previous TRs. The wav2vec2.0 model is refined by optimizing the prediction error. It is thus interesting to investigate whether this refinement can enhance the performance of wav2vec2.0 on downstream tasks.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.4" class="ltx_p">In this work, as an example Wav2vec2.0 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> is adopted as the self-supervised speech model. It integrates the Gumbel softmax quantization module from vq-wav2vec <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> in an end-to-end fashion. In wav2vec2.0, raw speech waveforms first pass through a series of convolutional layers to generate latent speech representations <span id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold">Z</span>, which are then masked and fed into the Transformer to obtain context representations <span id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold">C</span>. Simultaneously, quantized representations <span id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.4.3" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold">Q</span> are obtained via product quantization on <span id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.4.4" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold">Z</span>. The self-supervised loss function for pre-training comprises a contrastive loss and a diversity loss. The former discriminates positive samples from negative ones for the quantized representations at the masked positions. Meanwhile, the latter loss aims to enhance the representation ability of the quantization codebook by encouraging the model to utilize all codebook entries equally. After pre-training, the model can be applied to downstream tasks by cascading task-specific layers and fine-tuning the entire model using labeled data in combination with task-specific loss function(s).</p>

The reason of using historical speech waveforms is twofold: 1) the asynchronous relationship between the speech stimulus and BOLD signals is considered, in line with the mechanism of BOLD acquisition. Due to the inertia of changes in blood oxygen levels, the BOLD response reaches its peak after a latency period of several seconds, making historical information relevant. 2) the predictive coding theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> suggests that the human brain can effectively utilize long-term information in speech. Therefore, incorporating historical information into the speech input may enhance the model's ability to perform neural encoding.</p>

This framework reflects four categories of speech tasks: content, speaker, semantics and paralinguistics. We evaluate the performance on 3 content tasks including phoneme recognition (PR), ASR and keyword spotting (KS), 2 speaker tasks of speaker identification (SID) and automatic speaker verification (ASV), 2 semantic tasks including intent classification (IC) and slot filling (SF), and 1 paralinguistics task of emotional recognition (ER). When designing and training these prediction heads for downstream tasks, we follow the default configuration of SUPERB, except that the learning rate of 1e-3 is used for the SID task. The evaluation results of all compared models are obtained by applying them to downstream tasks following the SUPERB framework with our own implementation, except the results of vanilla-large which are published ones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

The results of the refined and vanilla models are shown in Table 1. We assess the reliability of our results by applying one-tailed paired t-test on each audio in the SUPERB test set for each downstream task. It shows that using an appropriate amount of historical audio information in the neural encoding model, the refined wav2vec2.0 model can achieve a similar performance with the vanilla on ER, KS and SF tasks, and outperform the vanilla on PR, IC, SID, ASR and ASV.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the downstream results are not significantly different from the vanilla wav2vec2 on some tasks. For the content tasks, we speculate that the proposed method is likely inhibited by the change in the audio domain on PR and ASR, both of which use the same domain as the vanilla-base. We thus evaluate the stimuli-pretrain model on same downstream tasks and the results are shown at the fourth row of Table 1. It can be found that the model will not benefit on downstream tasks from using additional data for pre-training, which can even degrade due to the domain shift. As the proposed refined model also experiences the domain migration through the alignment, the results of refining operations are thus promising for downstream tasks.</p>

Although we can conclude from aforementioned results that the refined model can extract better speech representations, an accurate illustration of how the speech representation is refined is not straightforward. For this, we examine how the parameters of self-attention in the Transformer layers change, which is shown in Fig. 2.
It can be observed that compared to vanilla, the bias of self-attention in the refined model has a significant change for <math id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math>, while the biases of <math id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Q" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">Q</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑄</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1c">Q</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="V" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">V</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝑉</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1c">V</annotation></semantics></math> have relatively small changes.

This will lead the refined model to focus on different parts of the features, resulting in different attention distributions and positive effects on some downstream tasks. Therefore, we speculate that such changes in attention distribution enable the model to learn relevant information on brain activation, thereby enabling a better understanding of speech.</p>

It does not follow a monotonic behaviour, which is probably caused by the fact that the acoustic and semantic understanding of human brain relies on both short-term and long-term cues contained in speech <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. This is consistent with the results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> that in the context of speech perception, human brains follow an information processing pipeline from word recognition, intention in sentences, emotion in stories, to speaker recognition.</p>

To confirm the neural encoding ability of the refined model, we follow the method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and compare the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between the true brain activations and that predicted by the speech representation models before and after refining. Specifically, a ridge regression is adopted to predict the brain activations
using the speech representations given by each layer of the vanilla or refined wav2vec2.0. Afterwards, the PCC is computed for each selected voxel, and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 3(b). It indicates that after refining the model, the PCCs between the predicted BOLD responses and true counterparts are generally higher. It is interesting that the maximum PCC is achieved in case of using the representations at the 9-th layer of wav2vec2.0 for prediction. This encourages to utilize such representations at middle layers to predict BOLD responses for model refinement in future works.</p>

Finally, as the SUPERB framework learns a weighted sum of the layer outputs for each downstream task, we carry out a deeper analysis on comparing the layer weights of refined and vanilla models on different downstream tasks, and calculate their change rates. The analytical results are presented in Fig. 4.
We observe that the change rates of layer weights are roughly inversely proportional to their absolute values, that is, the layer that plays an important role in a downstream task has a small change on its weight after being refined. The main function of our refined method is therefore to influence other secondary layers to better adapt to downstream tasks.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a refinement-based wav2vec2.0 model by building a neural encoding model to predict brain activations using speech. It was validated that self-supervised speech pre-trained models can encode brain activation clues into model parameters and extract better speech representations, indicating feasibility of using the universal relation between speech representation and brain activation in self-supervised learning. It was also shown that using historical information to help predict the BOLD response at current TR and thus downstream tasks.The proposed refining operation fills the gap between neuroscience and self-supervised speech representation models. It should be insightful that more efforts can be made to optimize these models using multiple sources of auditory and linguistic information contained in the brain activities, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios.</p>
