<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Acoustic sensing manifests great potential in various applications that encompass health monitoring, gesture interface and imaging by leveraging the speakers and microphones on smart devices. However, in ongoing research and development in acoustic sensing, one problem is often overlooked: the same speaker, when used concurrently for sensing and other traditional applications (like playing music), could cause interference in both making it impractical to use in the real world. The strong ultrasonic sensing signals mixed with music would overload the speaker’s mixer. To confront this issue of overloaded signals, current solutions are clipping or down-scaling, both of which affect the music playback quality and also sensing range and accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose CoPlay, a deep learning based optimization algorithm to cognitively adapt the sensing signal. It can 1) maximize the sensing signal magnitude within the available bandwidth left by the concurrent music to optimize sensing range and accuracy and 2) minimize any consequential frequency distortion that can affect music playback.
In this work, we design a deep learning model and test it on common types of sensing signals (sine wave or Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave FMCW) as inputs with various agnostic concurrent music and speech. First, we evaluated the model performance to show the quality of the generated signals. Then we conducted field studies of downstream acoustic sensing tasks in the real world. A study with 12 users proved that respiration monitoring and gesture recognition using our adapted signal achieve similar accuracy as no-concurrent-music scenarios, while clipping or down-scaling manifests worse accuracy. A qualitative study also manifests that the music play quality is not degraded, unlike traditional clipping or down-scaling methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Acoustic sensing has been an active field of research in mobile computing community. Typically, an acoustic sensing system leverages the acoustic sensors on commercial-off-the-shell (COTS) smart devices. The system emits inaudible custom ultrasound signals from the speaker and then records the reflections using microphones transforming the device into an active SONAR system that is capable of capturing millimeter-level motion in the environment enabling various applications such as human gesture recognition and tracking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Koteshwara et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Wang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Nandakumar et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, biosignal monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Nandakumar et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Wang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Song et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
Acoustic sensing offers unique advantages as a novel perception modality: 1) Unlike cameras, it works even in non-line-of-sight or poor light conditions, providing enhanced privacy preservation. 2) The speed of sound is many orders of magnitude slower than the speed of radio frequency (RF), allowing for millimeter-level sensing resolution with a significantly narrower bandwidth. 3) They harness the increasing number of speakers and microphones in IoT devices without necessitating hardware modifications. As such, acoustic sensing is promising in fields like Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and health monitoring. The research community has been actively working on improving acoustic sensing systems in terms of accuracy, security, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, one critical issue is often overlooked in ongoing research and developments in acoustic sensing: most systems assume the speaker solely plays the sensing signal. Yet, speakers are conventionally used for speech or music applications. Concurrently using audio applications when emitting sensing signals can cause an overload in the speaker’s mixer. To elaborate, a speaker mixer, or audio mixer, is a software component in the operating systems that mixes audio streams from different applications. To accomplish this, the mixer performs resampling, scaling, and addition to consolidate them into a single stream for output. If the value of the mixed signal exceeds the maximum numerical range supported by the DAC, we call this problem signal overload.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In consequence, the speaker mixer would take two possible actions: one is to clip off the overloaded part; another one is to down-scale the signal to ensure the maximum is within the allowable range, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1. Introduction ‣ CoPlay: Audio-agnostic Cognitive Scaling for Acoustic Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Currently, these two strategies are widely adopted by operating systems. In Android, Windows, and Linux, they clip off the exceeding portion; IOS and MacOS scale down all the audio streams by a factor.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>; Koteshwara et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> identified that both these methods will cause degraded quality of music or sensing. 1) Clipping results in distortion in the frequency domain. For example, if the user is playing music or answering a phone call, they will hear buzz sounds. The transmitted sensing signal is also distorted. Since the receiver-side ranging algorithms usually rely on accurate spectrum analysis, such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the clipping will negatively affect the sensing performance. 2) Although down-scaling will not distort the frequency domain, it could significantly decrease the transmitted power of the signal. On the one hand, the volume of the music play goes low thus affecting its usability. On the other hand, down-scaled sensing signals are so weak that they can not propagate far enough in the environment. It is an important factor in the sensing performance as many sensing systems assume that they can use a large volume for the ultrasound to reach a longer detection range.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Beyond identifying the essence of the concurrent music problem in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>; Koteshwara et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, some work tangentially address this using closed-form solutions like echo cancellation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Koteshwara et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> or interleaving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Nandakumar et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. But they are limited to certain tasks or hurts the performance. In this work, we aim to propose an algorithmic solution to this problem that outperforms either closed-form methods in prior work or clipping and down-scaling in the current OS.</p>

</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, achieving these two goals simultaneously is hard because tweaking the signal amplitude in the time domain will cause noisy distortion in the frequency domain.
For example, amplitude modulation(AM) will introduce noisy side bands beside the carrier frequency. While, in our case, dynamically scaling amplitude will cause even more frequency distortion and then compromise the sensing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, a deep learning algorithm is necessary to dynamically scale the signal, by formalizing these two objectives as an optimization problem.
We name it <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cognitive</span> scaling model, inspired by the concept of cognitive radar <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bell et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>, where the transmission (Tx) signal is adaptively adjusted based on environmental changes. The perception-action cycles of cognition algorithms enable real-time adaptation of the radar. In our paper, we dynamically adjust the Tx ultrasound sensing signal according to the concurrent music. The suggested cognitive scaling algorithm runs in the speaker mixer and aims to diminish the risk of overload distortion while preserving the quality of both sensing and music.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, the cognitive scaling neural network should work for agnostic music and various types of sensing signals. So, in this work, we examine our model with sine wave and frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) chirp, with different types of concurrent audio, including piano, hot songs, bass, and conversational podcasts. To elaborate, sine and FMCW are the most common signals for acoustic sensing regardless of the receiver-side algorithms. After adapting these signals using CoPlay, the receiver-side algorithm should still work as before, as long as the transmitted signal is barely distorted and is known to the receiver-side algorithms, such as the Doppler effect, time of arrival (ToA), dechirping, etc. More specifically, the sine wave <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Koteshwara et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Wang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Mao et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> is simple, narrow-band, but susceptible to interference and noise and has limited range resolution. In contrast, acoustic sensing systems using FMCW chirps <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Nandakumar et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Zhou et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Li et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>)</cite> are better correlated and have flexible range resolution. But it is more complex in frequency spectrum thus more challenging for our model to generate accurately.
We had a workshop paper<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(cop, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>(anonymized) presenting preliminary results of only sine waves to embark on prior research conversation. But it couldn’t extend to FMCW signals. In contrast, CoPlay incorporates advanced algorithms with broader experiments, allowing it to process both sine and FMCW.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the above challenges, we design a cognitive scaling neural network with WaveNet backbone and custom layers. The model can take multiple types of sensing signal and agnostic concurrent music as input. The output is the cognitively scaled sensing signal. Specifically, we design a custom link function with music as bias, which acts as a filter to normalize the signal within dynamic bandwidth. Besides, we design a kernel to alleviate low-frequency noise stemming from the spectral bias and aliasing in convolution layers<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Rahaman et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. At last, we encode the above optimization goals in the loss terms to maximize the amplitude and minimize the frequency distortion.</p>

<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the model performance beyond numerical loss, we also conduct field studies to show how the adapted signal works in downstream tasks.

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">These acoustic sensing research usually focus on improving the sensing accuracy in the absence of concurrent music. However, this problem could cause distortion or lack of power in the received sensing signal. To elaborate, the distortion degrades the receiver-side sensing accuracy because the sensing depends on precise frequency; theoretically, it is a convolution property (when using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or correlation), covering methods of the phase-based/frequency-based, DOA and SAR. This underscores the reason behind our incorporation of FFT within the loss function.
As for the external background noise, which is more often mentioned in these works, we can easily filter it out with a high-pass filter. However, internal noise—like music playing from the same speaker can bring about different problems, as highlighted in the introduction section.</p>

In contrast, CoPlay introduces advanced techniques with broader and larger-scale experiments, enabling it to process both sine and FMCW.

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">To elaborate, it combines a non-auto-regressive sequence-to-sequence structure with WaveNet backbones. While WaveNet architecture was originally developed for AR modeling, it has since become a basic backbone of various audio models. And we validate this choice in the micro-benchmark section by experimental comparison with sample CNN and RNN backbones. In detail, it employs a stack of dilated convolutional layers which provides better reception fields than conventional ones, making it adept at raw waveform modeling and processing sequential data more efficiently than RNNs.

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">At the early stage of experiments, we observe non-negligible low-frequency noise in the model output, especially when modeling FMCW chirps. It is a common problem discussed in the computer vision community that the neural network learns low frequency faster and also down-scaling in layers like convolution and max pooling could induce aliasing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, we design a custom <span id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sinc</span> kernel for band-passing middle activations to isolate specific frequency bands of interest within the signal. The unique properties of the <span id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(</span>sinc) filter, notably its brick-wall characteristic in the frequency domain as its Fourier transform is a rectangular function (Appendix  <a href="#A2" title="Appendix B Sinc function as a brick-wall filter. ‣ CoPlay: Audio-agnostic Cognitive Scaling for Acoustic Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B</span></a>), makes it a preferred choice of filters over Hamming, etc. So, by putting <span id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(</span>sinc) kernel as a layer before the final link function, it mitigates artifacts that may arise in the first stage.
For implementation, we use <span id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sinc_impulse_response</span> function in the Pytorch experimental nightly version. The negative of it is a high-pass filter. And they can sum to one band-pass filter or more.
To demonstrate its effectiveness, we perform ablation in the micro-benchmark section.</p>

<div id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another advantage is its potential to serve as a parameterized kernel when building models for new types of sensing signals other than chirp or sine. A parameterized cutoff could learn a dynamic filter for even multiple signals trained in one model. While we currently train standalone models dedicated to each sensing signal, so that each model achieves optimal performance since we focus on substantiating and validating the underlying concept.</p>

Besides, we will further assess the performance in downstream field studies of respiration and gesture detection in the following section. The code will go public on Github upon the acceptance of the paper.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, the model manifests the capability of generalizing to different types of music or speech, since the cross-dataset error is similar to that of cross-type data error for both sine and FMCW chirps. While intra-dataset usually outperforms the others because the distribution between testing and training is close, the intra-dataset results in chirp are a bit counter-intuitive and it takes 10x more epochs to converge. We think the reason could be that chirp is more complex and needs more data to train, while intra-dataset trains on only 6̃0% of cross-dataset/cross-type experiments.
Besides, it is worth mentioning that the cross-type results in the speech group are also good. This is a particularly significant generalization result, since the speech category stands out as the most distinguishable type of audio, compared with music of piano, hot songs, and bass.</p>

They are training loss including three sub-loss values for sine and an additional variance-loss for FMCW, which we defined above to even the amplitude in the target bandwidth. By default weights, each sub-loss ranges from 0 to 1.
We observe that target-loss and amplitude-loss are the bottlenecks, aligning with the intuition that minimizing frequency distortion and maximizing the amplitude are opposed objectives, which is a common issue in multi-task learning. This table serves as a reference for tweaking the weights of loss terms to specific downstream task requirements. For instance, near-field sensing tasks can sacrifice amplitude for minimal distortion.</p>

In detail, we train with the same sub-loss experiment and test with increasing levels of music volume. The x-axis indicates the ratio of sensing signal volume and music volume. The default ratio is 1:1, and 0.6:1.4 is when music is roughly double in power, equivalently 7.3db louder.

Likewise, certain sensing algorithms employ cross-correlation (Xcorr) to obtain the ranging profile instead of utilizing FFT. Nevertheless, they basically use equivalent computation components: convolution or even DFT. For instance, an accelerated computation of Xcorr is to perform a frequency-domain Xcorr, which is faster than that in the time domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dr. Erol Kalkan, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, because shifting a signal in the time domain is equivalently scaling it in the frequency domain.
Therefore, in addition to plotting the FFT spectrums of the generated signal, Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 4.3. Spectral analysis ‣ 4.

By rolling the signal in the time domain, the distinct peak in Xcorr output changes with the number of shifts as expected. In summary, this justifies that our adapted signal works well even if the receiver-side sensing algorithm uses Xcorr.</p>

Furthermore, the entire audio is actually pre-known by the speaker in many cases. For instance, Java sound API can load the audio file into memory and then buffer the sliding windows into input stream. That’s saying, the speaker can run the inference upfront and before playing the processed signal.

Note that we aim to show the effectiveness of CoPlay from the perspective of downstream task accuracy here, while many other factors could affect the accuracy, including the receiver-side sensing algorithm. So, the two selective ones are a baseline to show the relative effectiveness of our CoPlay V.S. baselines; Improving the receiver-side sensing algorithm is not the focus of this study.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed above, almost all receiver-side algorithms are based on the Fourier transform in some way. Therefore, for the respiration rate detection, we play a sine wave signal at 18kHz and extract that frequency bin in the received signal, whose amplitude is proportional to the chest-to-device distance. Next, we apply peak detection on the amplitude waveform to get BPM. We use the basic Scipy peak detection function with default parameters; it finds all local maxima by simple comparison of neighboring values. Besides, to eliminate noisy motion other than the breath -for example, body or head rotation- we apply a band-pass filter before peak detection. The filter selects out 8-22Hz because the human breath rate is typically 12-18Hz. Specifically, we use the same window size of 30s and interval of 10s as the Vernier belt ground truth. The beginning ¡30s are padded.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">For the gesture recognition task, we transmit FMCW of 18k-20kHz and then dechirp the received signal with cross-correlation to get a range profile. At last, each window subtracts its previous window to eliminate the static environment and let the motions stand out. Note that nearby motions other than the hand would degrade sensing performance. So, we ask the users to try their best to stay still, since robustness under noise is not the focus of this study; we control these conditions to isolate the effectiveness of CoPlay only.
Finally, the range profile is input into a simple CNN classifier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Document, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> as a single-channel 2D feature map. The CNN is a simple 2-conv-layer network with max pooling, ReLU, plus three linear layers at the end. Then by training with Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss, we got a 3-class classifier.
Besides, to avoid overfitting on our small dataset, we augment the feature map by adding Gaussian noise in the training dataloader. This regulation helps the training loss converge fast and stable.
The classifier is trained in a leave-one-user-out manner and the following results are the average accuracy.</p>

The other three sessions run on the iPhone, playing the same audio except that the third case will cause down-scaling instead. Sub-session 1 and 3 are baselines to compare with our method in sub-session 2.
Sub-sessions 2 and 3 use the same audio clip, which consists of samples from the datasets we used in the micro-benchmark section. It concatenates three 20-second clips from each of the three types of audio, including piano, hot songs, and speech. At the beginning of the first session, the user starts by putting on the belt and sitting in front of the device. Then they click the button on the phone screen to start recording. In between the sub-sessions, we switch the phone. Next, for the second session, they can take off the belt. Likewise, they will also click the button to start recording and playing the guiding video.
Upon finishing every 3 sub-sessions, the user fills in the qualitative questionnaire about music quality and volume.</p>

Note that it is equivalent to double the sensing distance, as signal intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.
In summary, both clipping and downscaling underperform our algorithm. Clipping emerges as the worst, even than large scaling down; while downscaling would get worse quadratically with increasing distance in practice, although the drop is less noticeable when compared with the worst case from clipping in our experiment.
In the subsequent section, we will elucidate these observations by visually analyzing their breakdowns.</p>

First, it is obvious that the no-music scenario for both Android and IOS is stronger than our cognitively scaled signal. While clipping also keeps the received amplitude strong, it is significantly noisy because it is distorted by the mixer at the transmitter. Relatively, CoPlay and no-music scenarios are clear periodic waveforms.
Secondly, the downscale case is almost two times weaker than the no-music case, while CoPlay is only 15% weaker. Besides, its crests and troughs are not as observable as the others, which is ineffective for peak detection.
The ground truth BPM of the two selected samples are a) 18.5 and b) 18.9. As shown in the legend in the figures, CoPlay and the no-music baseline are close to the ground truth BPM while clip and downscale have a larger error. The dots along each line are the individual breath selected by the peak detection algorithm.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.SSS3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">The score of Q.1 justifies that clipping does cause audible noise, basically buzzing, while CoPlay and down-scaling do not.
Q.2 manifests that down-scaling hurts the power of audio signals, resulting in the users being unable to hear the audio at a sufficient volume. To elaborate, in the study, we calibrated the system volume of the phone to 50db, a common loudness of music playback or a nearby conversational talk. The volume was measured by another smartphone App placed next to the study device. When down-scaling happens, the music volume reduces by 6db per each half down-scaling.
Q.3 is to prove that the computation overhead of CoPlay does not cause any discontinuity or delay between the chunks of processed clips.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, our system handles two types of sensing signals on two downstream applications. In the future, in order to explore the full extent of applicable scenarios and thoroughly assess the versatility of the proposed approach, it would be prudent to engage in a more expansive array of field studies and sensing signals. These studies could extend beyond the initial scope of simple tasks and delve into more intricate downstream tasks such as more fine-grained gesture recognition. Specifically, evaluating the algorithm’s performance in challenging environments, characterized by varying degrees of interference (like motion, external noise, etc), could yield valuable insights into its robustness and effectiveness under diverse conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, we recognize a potential escalation in computational costs, particularly when dealing with multiple channels. Presently, our assumptions are based on the notion that devices with multiple channels duplicate the same signal into each channel. However, in the realm of 3D spatial audio applications, there exists the possibility of having slightly different signals per channel. Although our algorithm remains non-intrusive to the music itself, the need for custom cognitive scaling for each channel introduces an increase in computational demands. It would be worthy to delve deep into evaluating the computation cost of our algorithm in these more realistic scenarios and apply state-of-the-art acceleration methods from the perspectives of both the model compression and on-device streaming data processing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, we aim to delve deeper into investigating the behavior of speaker mixers through the execution of real-world experiments across a more diverse range of devices. This expanded investigation seeks to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how speaker mixers function in various technological contexts. Besides, the variant of the number of sensors and their positions are also relevant factors remained to be investigated. For example, smart speakers like Amazon Echo Dot and Google Home have much more powerful speakers and the full stack runs on unique IoT operating systems, the combination of which could bring distinct insights to the scope of our concurrent music problem.</p>
