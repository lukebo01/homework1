<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The automated classification of stuttered speech has significant implications for timely assessments providing assistance to speech language pathologists. Despite notable advancements in the field, the cases in which multiple disfluencies occur in speech require attention. We have taken a progressive approach to fill this gap by classifying multi-stuttered speech more efficiently. The problem has been addressed by firstly curating a dataset of multi-stuttered disfluencies from SEP-28k audio clips. Secondly, employing Whisper, a state-of-the-art speech recognition model has been leveraged by using its encoder and taking the problem as multi label classification. Thirdly, using a 6 encoder layer Whisper and experimenting with various layer freezing strategies, a computationally efficient configuration of the model was identified. The proposed configuration achieved micro, macro, and weighted F1-scores of 0.88, 0.85, and 0.87, correspondingly on an external test dataset i.e. Fluency-Bank. In addition, through layer freezing strategies, we were able to achieve the aforementioned results by fine-tuning a single encoder layer, consequently, reducing the model’s trainable parameters from 20.27 million to 3.29 million. This research study unveils the contribution of the last encoder layer in the identification of disfluencies in stuttered speech. Consequently, it has led to a computationally efficient approach which makes the model more adaptable for various dialects and languages.</p>

The most common disfluencies include blocks, interjections, sound repetition, word repetition, and prolongation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> which are demonstrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Optimizing Multi-Stuttered Speech Classification: Leveraging Whisper’s Encoder for Efficient Parameter Reduction in Automated Assessment" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this era of Artificial Intelligence, automated systems are assisting professionals in various domains i.e. medical, finance, education etc. Nevertheless, in the field of psychology, particularly for Speech Language Pathologists (SLP), the assessment of stuttering patients still requires considerable cognitive effort and is time-intensive. Conventionally, SLPs have to manually identify the disfluencies in speech, count them and calculate parameters like speech rate, stuttered words per minute etc <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Consequently, the outcome is dependent on the expertise of SLPs. This creates a need for an automated tool that can assist SLPs in evaluating stuttering patients.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although there have been numerous studies in this area, it still remains an evolving field.

However, the study presented by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> only deals with single stuttering, whilst in most real world scenarios, more than one disfluencies can co-occur.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Disfluencies in stuttered speech are intricate in nature and have been addressed through various techniques applied to audio data. The acquisition of transformer-based models has revolutionized multiple domains, including computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, natural language processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and speech processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In terms of automated stuttered speech, researchers have explored the transformer-based model Wav2vec2.0 which has shown commendable performances in various studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The labeled datasets SEP-28k and FluencyBank proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, has been acquired by the researchers. However, the majority of the studies are on single disfluency types, despite the fact that multiple disfluencies can occur in a single audio clip as well. In this section, we will cover the studies addressing multi-stutter labels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Disfluencies often co-occur with other types of disfluencies in real-world scenarios. Mapping this issue into deep learning parlance, each instance may consist of multiple labels, framing this as a multi-label classification problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In the domain of speech processing, numerous researchers have employed multi-label classification for emotion recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, voice disorders <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and speech recognition use-cases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
In the context of multi-stuttered scenarios, the authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> have conceptualized the issue as a multi-label classification problem. They have proposed Resnet50 as a solution for converting audio into spectrograms and feeding the images in the network. The researchers have utilized SEP-28k and FluencyBank datasets for training and testing. While the paper acknowledges the issue regarding data imbalance, it doesn’t explicitly address the resolution of the problem. In addition, the splits of the datasets play a major role in the outcome of the model, however, they are not discussed in the paper. The influence of dataset splits has been explored in the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, as it highlights the capability of the model’s efficacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> have also taken it as a multi-label problem and explored the cross-language capabilities of a model so it can be more generalized. In contrast to the aforementioned study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, this study explicitly mentions the training, validation, and testing splits of the datasets. This study uses the SEP-28k Extended dataset, and KsoF dataset which is based on English and German stuttered speech. The proposed method uses Wav2vec2.0 along with a sequence classifier for end-to-end stuttering detection and classification. Furthermore, they have applied multi task learning to incorporate regularization. The evaluation metric acquired was F1-score for different combinations of training data and modifications. For the SEP-28k-E test set the F1-scores Block, Interjection, Prolongation, Sound Repetition, and Word Repetition achieved were 0.32, 0.77, 0.54, 0.50, and 0.56, respectively. Furthermore, for the fluency bank dataset, the F1-scores were 0.31, 0.82, 0.57, 0.61, 0.45 in correspondence with the above mentioned disfluency types. This has provided a new direction for solving the task at hand, however, the paper does not cater to the quality of the data by omitting the discussions on inter-annotator agreements in the labeling of these disfluencies. In Contrast, the study proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> has produced better results by only acquiring the high inter-annotator agreement labels. They have only considered the instances where all three annotators agreed on the labels. So, even if the quantity of the data was decreased, better results were achieved due to the quality of the dataset. In addition, they have not applied any preprocessing steps to the audio clips.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The significance of preprocessing has been established in the paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The study has followed a series of data cleaning and preprocessing steps with significant improvement in the results. Furthermore, the approach proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> regarding the data quality of quantity was also used in this paper. The dataset used in this study is SEP-28k for training and FluencyBank for testing purposes. The paper acquires Whisper for the classification of disfluencies in stuttered speech, demonstrating superior performance compared to results obtained with the Wav2vec2.0 model. The paper has experimented with various data-splits achieving the highest average F1-score of 0.81. However, the study does not consider the multi stuttering cases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Hence, there exists a notable gap in the literature which necessitates the integration of multi-label classification and considers the proper dataset splits of training, validation and testing sets. Next, with the inclusion of preprocessing and cleaning of the input data based on transformer-based models, this research can be taken forward for real-world scenarios. However, another important aspect that needs to be addressed is the multi-label data for stuttered speech. While SEP-28k and FluencyBank encompass certain occurrences of multi-label instances. On the other hand, by prioritizing the dataset quality and choosing to include only instances where all three annotators agree on the same labels, the multi-label number of instances was reduced significantly. In this context, scarcity presents a challenge to the learning of the models. Therefore, this emphasizes the need for a dataset that specifically is tailored to multi-stuttered speech. Lastly, building upon the findings presented in the referenced paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, where Whisper has outperformed Wav2vec2.0. Our study, in conjunction with other mentioned gaps, will also leverage Whisper for the automated classification of disfluencies in the context of multi-stuttered speech.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, two primary datasets SEP-28k <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and FluencyBank <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> have been leveraged for training and testing the models. SEP-28k consists of  28k instances, and each audio clip is 3 seconds long. These clips were extracted from eight podcasts and labeled with five major disfluency types; prolongation, sound repetition, word repetition, interjections, and blocks. Similarly, FluencyBank has been labelled and consists of the same audio length as SEP-28k. It consists of  4k instances and is mostly leveraged for testing purposes. Lastly, both datasets consist of audio of English speakers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the dataset’s quality, data cleaning steps from the paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> have been followed considering their improved outcomes. At first, the experimentation was limited to cases where all three annotators agreed on a certain label. Next, labels that accounted for less than 1% of the dataset’s representation were eliminated. These were non-disfluent labels, like Natural Pause, Hard to Understand, Speechless, Bad Audio Quality, and Music. Moreover, in order to maintain uniformity, audio fragments that lasted less than three seconds were also not included. To reduce the possibility of influencing the outcome of the model, background noises were reduced from the audio clips. Finally, audio samples that included multiple speakers were also excluded as they may complicate classification and interpretation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the study presented by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the influence of data partitioning has been explored. The authors have proposed and experimented with three speaker-exclusive dataset splits i.e. SEP-28k-E, SEP-28k-E-T and SEP-28k-D. The training split of SEP-28k-E consists of clips with the top four dominant speakers. The remaining clips are partitioned for testing and validation. SEP-28k-T and SEP-28k-D are similar as they are using the testing and validation split of SEP-28k-E in their training splits, and testing them on the top four dominant speakers. The splits of SEP-28k-E can exhibit the capability of a model by training them on a few speakers with more audio clips and testing on various speakers. On the other hand, SEP-28k-T and SEP-28k-D can identify the ability of the model to learn from fewer examples of various speakers. In the experimental work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the authors have investigated a different setup that combines training and validation data, using the test split for validation purposes. These datasets, which we will refer to as SEP-28k-E-merged and SEP-28k-T-merged, are shown in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.1 Datasets ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Optimizing Multi-Stuttered Speech Classification: Leveraging Whisper’s Encoder for Efficient Parameter Reduction in Automated Assessment" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> with their splits. These additional splits are also included in the respective study.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, to curate multi-stuttered data, specific conditions needed to be met. The audio from the same episodes and the same speakers were required. Since in each episode featured multiple speakers, we manually had to label each of them so they could be concatenated. Next, two audio samples consisting of distinct disfluent labels were then concatenated using Python library AudioSegment. In addition, if both the labels were ”NoStutteredWords”, they were also concatenated. The pipeline for the multi-stuttered dataset is illustrated in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.2 Data Curation for Multi-Stutter ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Optimizing Multi-Stuttered Speech Classification: Leveraging Whisper’s Encoder for Efficient Parameter Reduction in Automated Assessment" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Whisper is an encoder-decoder architecture based on weakly supervised transformers that are state-of-the-art at the moment, particularly for speech recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Whisper uses a 16 kHz sampling rate for the audio clips that are fed into it. Next, these audio clips are transformed into a log Mel spectrogram representation. After that, two 1-D convolutional layers are used to process them in order to extract features. Then, depending on the requirements of a given task, these features are fed into an encoder and a decoder. To enable the model to be used for a variety of use cases, such as speech recognition, language identification, voice detection, and speech translation, the decoder is trained in a multitask format. However, for the classification of multi-stuttered disfluency types, only the encoder part of the model is required.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After curating the dataset for multi-stuttered speech, speaker-exclusive data splits discussed in the section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Datasets ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Optimizing Multi-Stuttered Speech Classification: Leveraging Whisper’s Encoder for Efficient Parameter Reduction in Automated Assessment" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a> are then fine-tuned. In this study, to cater for multi-stuttered instances, encoder-only Whisper has been leveraged by fine-tuning its pre-trained English base model. In order to adapt the model to our specific task, we used Hugging Face Library to acquire its module namely, Whisper for Audio Classification. <span id="footnote4" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">4</span><a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/Whisper" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/Whisper</a></span></span></span>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First, the base models of Wav2vec2.0 and Whisper were finetuned on the multi-stuttered dataset on all the splits. Based on the results, Whisper was chosen for further experimentation. Next, the encoder layer optimization strategy was applied, in which the first three encoder layers of the Whisper model were frozen while fine-tuning. The insights of the optimization strategy were gained from earlier research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. For further reduction of trainable parameters, we have also experimented with the freezing of the feature extractor. In addition, we have also included the experimentation of freezing the first four, first five layers, and all layers of the encoder. Lastly, the Whisper model with only four encoder layers was also fine-tuned. However, the results exhibited a significant decline, which led us to discontinue further experimentation.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we begin by analyzing the outcomes between the Wav2vec2.0 and Whisper models. The results led us to continue with the Whisper model for further experimentation to achieve the classification of multi-stuttered disfluencies in speech. Next, we have explored the impact of freezing the feature extractor on the outcome. The findings demonstrated that freezing the feature extractor does not affect the results, thereby preferring the respective configuration with reduced trainable parameters. Finally, building on the paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, we extended our experimentation to the remaining encoder layers. Through these experiments, we identified the optimal layer freezing configuration of the model, and compared with with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the literature, the research on multi-stuttered classification of disfluency is notably scarce. In the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, authors have focused on this problem leveraging Wav2vec2.0 for the classification of disfluency types in multi-stuttered speech. However, in the paper, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> Whisper appeared to be a more suitable choice for this task. To make a concrete choice between these two models we fine-tuned both Wav2vec2.0 and Whisper. The comparative analysis in table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4 Results and Discussion ‣ Optimizing Multi-Stuttered Speech Classification: Leveraging Whisper’s Encoder for Efficient Parameter Reduction in Automated Assessment" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> demonstrates that Whisper is a better choice across all the data splits in contrast to Wav2vec2.0. For this experimentation, Wav2vec2.0’s base model which consists of 12 encoder layers was acquired. In contrast, Whisper’s base model consisting of 6 encoder layers was fine-tuned. All the Layers were kept unfrozen in both of the models. It is noticeable in the table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4 Results and Discussion ‣ Optimizing Multi-Stuttered Speech Classification: Leveraging Whisper’s Encoder for Efficient Parameter Reduction in Automated Assessment" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> that there is a considerable variation of results between the models. Given their architectures, one of the key differences between Wav2vec2.0 and Whisper is their approaches to input representation of waveforms, potentially leading to substantial differences in results. Whisper converts the raw input into mel-spectrograms which are then passed to convolutional layers for feature extraction. On the other hand, Wav2vec2.0 directly extracts these features from raw audio through convolutional layers. Applying the convolutional layers directly on raw waveforms extracts more features as they are learned through trainable parameters. It seems that acquiring features through convolutional should have better outcomes as it is learning more features but it may not be necessary. For the respective task, features that are related to human speech are more relevant and also limit the computational head on the models. Therefore, one of the major reasons Whisper is performing better could be due to the usage of mel-spectrograms for feature extraction. Mel-spectrograms mimic the human auditory system, and these finite features are then passed on to convolutional layers and eventually to the encoder layers.</p>

Based on the groundwork laid by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, it was proved through experimentation that freezing the initial layers of the encoder model will yield better results. Consequently, this methodology will have fewer trainable parameters. Therefore, we experimented with this particular configuration of freezing the first three layers of the model frozen. Building on this study, we also experimented with freezing the feature extractor for further reduction of parameters.

<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Keeping this configuration of the frozen feature extractor, we also froze the remaining three layers one by one and analyzed the results. Table <a href="#S4.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ 4 Results and Discussion ‣ Optimizing Multi-Stuttered Speech Classification: Leveraging Whisper’s Encoder for Efficient Parameter Reduction in Automated Assessment" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> presents the average and class-wise F1-scores of each frozen layer strategy. Notably, it can be observed that the F1-scores of the first three layers frozen and the first five layers frozen are comparable. Analyzing the results of freezing the first five layers and all six layers, a significant difference is apparent in table <a href="#S4.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ 4 Results and Discussion ‣ Optimizing Multi-Stuttered Speech Classification: Leveraging Whisper’s Encoder for Efficient Parameter Reduction in Automated Assessment" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. Hence, this observation highlights the contribution of the last layer in the identification of multi-stuttered disfluencies. Therefore, freezing the top 5 layers is the most optimal configuration for the respective task reducing the learnable parameters to 3.29 million.</p>

In addition, it’s noteworthy that the Whisper model’s variant with 6 encoder layers was used in our experiments, and Wav2vec2.0 model’s large variant which consists of 24 encoder layers was used for the respective task. Therefore, Wav2vec2.0 large variant had 315.70 million trainable parameters, and our proposed whisper model configuration had 20.72 million trainable parameters.</p>

<p id="S4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, through our experimental design, we have reached the conclusion that the last encoder layer of Whisper has a significant effect as it plays an eminent role in the identification of multi-stuttered disfluency types. In addition, we have fine-tuned the model with fewer trainable parameters without compromising the results. Our experimentation is a step forward towards a resource efficient approach for this task, as we were able to narrow down to the most contributing layer.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study aims to classify multi-stuttered disfluencies, a research area seldom explored in the community. By curation of a multi-stuttered dataset, and through extensive experimentation, we were able to achieve notable outcomes by acquiring Whisper. We have also explored Wav2vec2.0 for multi-stuttered disfluencies, however, Whisper has outperformed in terms of F1-scores and computational efficiency. The micro, macro and weighted F1-scores achieved were 0.88, 0.85, and 0.87 respectively, using Whisper’s small variant which only consists of 6 encoder layers. In addition, through our experimental design, we were able to identify the most contributing encoder layer for the task at hand. So by just fine-tuning one encoder layer, we were able to achieve commendable outcomes. Therefore, the learnable parameters of the model were reduced from 20.27 million to just 3.29 million. The innovative approach presented in this paper is an eminent contribution leading to automated assessment of stuttered speech. Looking ahead, we aim to explore its applicability in multilingual cases, along with parameter efficient fine-tuning techniques to make these models more adaptable for different languages and dialects. Nevertheless, a diverse dataset in terms of speakers and disfluency types remains a crucial objective for broader applicability in the real world.</p>
