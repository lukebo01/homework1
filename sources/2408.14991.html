<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the emergence of transformer<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, a lot of automation and transformation across the entire Artificial Intelligence (AI) landscape has taken place, especially with the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs). The foundational goal of AI is to replicate human senses such as sight, hearing, touch, and smell. In a wider context, these modalities are a mode of communication tied to a particular sensory channel, like vision for the visual modality and hearing for the auditory modality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">For example, a sound recording scenario that captures the <span id="S1.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">conversation between two people</span> contains information about utterances of two distinct speakers, acoustic information; sound, noise, vibrations, linguistic content, and prosodic cues</span>. Fundamentally, an audio-based AI system must take in the audio, comprehend, and make inferences about the complex auditory information sources to achieve human-level accuracy. Some popular or key audio/speech-related tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), question answering, speech enhancement, speech emotion recognition, and speech separation have gained significant interest.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional ASR systems had inherent limitations due to their reliance on manually engineered features to extract linguistic content from speech signals, lacking a deeper understanding of language. This rigid and finite approach makes it difficult to adapt to language diversity. To overcome this, recent advances in end-to-end neural network architectures map directly from speech to text. It can efficiently transfer knowledge and learning to different languages and dialects. The key factor in the rising popularity of transformer architectures is the ability to capture long-term dependency compared to other deep learning models, such as recurring neural networks (RNN), which tend to encounter vanishing or expanding gradients. The transformer’s success in speech and audio processing is the introduction of self- and multi-head attention mechanisms. It also allows parallel self-attentions across multiple attention heads, enabling the model to capture long input with contextual information<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. With this paper, we urge you to aid the research on building ASR systems with foundational models for diverse languages.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper provides a generic ASR system review that would be leveraged for all the downstream tasks such as (i) identifying cognitive impairments and dementia, (ii) investigating speech coding for data transmission, (iii) detecting hate speech, (iv) spoken content summarization or speech summarization (v) techniques for speech signal separation in a complex environment (vi) emotion recognition in speech (vii) identifying positive and hopeful speech (viii) facial animation and lip-syncing(ix) integration in multimodal and multi-resolution context (x) speaker embedding and extraction (xi) advancement in voice activity detection (xii) usage in speaker diarization (xiii) multi speech context. Note that we do not cover the research studies that use speech recognition as one module for another speech task. Rather, we aim to focus on cutting-edge end-to-end speech recognition systems.
This paper implements a two-tier structured taxonomy in end-to-end automatic speech recognition to enhance readability and interdisciplinary integration. This taxonomy is organized around the dual dimensions of application and challenges. Firstly, it enables researchers to identify relevant applications in their domain, facilitating a deeper connection to related areas. Secondly, it allows for a unified, formula-driven comparison of model designs across different ASR domains, promoting cross-disciplinary collaboration. This approach provides a comprehensive view of ASR research, combining specific application insights with broader theoretical frameworks, thereby encouraging the breakdown of domain boundaries and fostering more effective communication and idea exchange.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper correlates with previous surveys that have examined related work on ASR, specifically on the lingual aspect using state-of-the-art transformers. Earlier work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> most prominently covered feature-engineering and machine-learning work. Recent surveys cover transformers and their modalities or application in vision, time-series, video, and speech or audio processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to specifically highlight the development of speech recognition systems using state-of-the-art end-to-end transformer architectures and their self-attention mechanisms across linguistic approaches.
In this paper, We conducted a targeted literature review using Google Scholar, focusing on recent academic publications <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">within the last five years</span> that cover research on speech recognition using a transformer in a linguistic context. Our refined search included terms like <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Speech Recognition and Transformer</span> for <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Bilingual</span>, <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Multilingual</span>, <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Crosslingual</span> system. From the initial selection of 123 papers, we discarded 14 due to limited relevance or contribution. The remaining papers were categorized based on their focus: 32 on monolingual, 25 on bilingual, 28 on multilingual, and 24 on crosslingual speech recognition. This categorization aids in understanding research advancements in each linguistic category and highlights the most utilized corpora, languages, acoustic features, and models in these categories. This revision maintains the essential details while providing a clearer and more concise overview of the review process and its outcomes.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Speech recognition systems have undergone significant progress since the early 1950s. A pioneering effort by Audrey at Bell Labs<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> was to distinguish between digits from the audio, followed by the advancement of the MIT Lincoln Lab<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> that was able to recognize ten phonemes of spoken utterances. Later, such speech recognition systems were built that could recognise whole words <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. These systems were speaker-specific and posed a serious problem with the demand for a larger vocabulary size to develop an efficient ASR system. In the 1980s, non-speaker-specific Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> were introduced for modelling speech and the n-gram language models to handle large vocabulary. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the HMM-GMM model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> was the dominant framework for more realistic scenarios with conversational speech, phone calls, conferences, etc. In the 2000s, neural networks became significantly popular, leading researchers as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to combine feedforward neural networks with HMMs. It was in the mid-2010s when deep learning techniques such as long-short-term memory (LSTM) and RNNs could capture the seq-2-modelling of ASR. Despite significant improvement in the state-of-the-art, these models could not capture long-term dependency or context, which was further overcome by the introduction of transformers.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Traditional ASR: Architecture</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The traditional ASR architecture consists of (i) <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">front-end</span>, which involves pre-processing such as noise reduction, normalization, voice activity detection, and feature extraction, transforms the audio signal into a set of features (like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients or MFCCs) that represent the phonetic content of the speech, making it easier for the model to process. (ii) <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">back-end</span> encompasses acoustic modelling (maps the extracted features to phonemes or speech units), pronunciation modelling (translates phonemes into words, considering variations in speech), language modelling (predicts word sequences, providing context and improving recognition accuracy), and decoding (combines these models’ outputs to produce the final text transcription).
Traditional ASR systems were based on HMMs and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> for acoustic modelling. HMMs are effective in modelling time-series data like speech, and GMMs are used to represent the probability distribution of different speech features. However, they have limited contextual understanding and cannot model the non-linear relationship between speech signals and variability in speech. Even the inherited property of GMM, such as the assumption of every feature as independent, does not correlate with the speech signal. Their lack of computational efficiency, scalability, and adaptability makes it harder to train the system on large-size datasets, new speech patterns, accents, or noisy environments. Some of these drawbacks of traditional ASR were overcome by seq-2-seq <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> models such as RNN, which was able to process the entire audio sequence and output in a single step, eliminating the need for separate acoustic, pronunciation, and language models. Their recurrent architecture limits the parallel computation, leading to longer training times. Additionally, they struggle to process long audio sequences due to difficulty capturing long-range dependency, which was partially resolved by introducing attention mechanisms and transformers as in sec <a href="#S2.SS3" title="2.3 End-to-End Transformers: A Generic Architecture ‣ 2 Background ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">As proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, the vanilla transformer as end-to-end architecture is primarily introduced for machine translation and other sequence-to-sequence (seq-2-seq) tasks. This architecture represented a significant paradigm shift in natural language processing (NLP) tasks thanks to its innovative use of attention mechanisms. It is composed of 6 identical, stacked encoder-decoder blocks. These identical blocks contain multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward layer. It allows for longer relationships or dependency in data for large-scale language modelling. We briefly cover the architecture of the transformer with encoder-decoder blocks, specifically elaborating on self-attention and the multi-head attention mechanism.

<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Decoder Block</span> The decoder, like the encoder, is made up of a stack of identical layers, each comprising three sub-layers. These include a masked multi-head attention layer, a multi-head attention layer that attends to the output of the encoder, and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network similar in structure to that of the encoder. The masked multi-head attention layer is unique to the decoder. It ensures that the predictions for a particular token depend only on the earlier tokens, not any future tokens. This is achieved by masking future positions within the self-attention layers of the decoder. After each sub-layer in the decoder, as in the encoder, layer normalization is also applied. Including the position-wise fully connected feed-forward network in the encoder and decoder is critical for handling variable-length sequences.</p>

In the Transformer architecture, the initial step involves tokenizing the input sequence, which segments the input into smaller, manageable units termed tokens. These tokens are then translated into embedding vectors, which serve as dense numerical representations of the tokenized input. A critical step in this process is the addition of positional encoding to these embedding vectors. This step is vital because Transformers process input in parallel and lack inherent mechanisms to discern the sequential order of tokens.

<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For speech processing, transformers must handle continuous audio signals, which are longer and more complex than text. As described in section <a href="#S2.SS3" title="2.3 End-to-End Transformers: A Generic Architecture ‣ 2 Background ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3</span></a>, the encoder-decoder architecture is utilized with some alteration for speech processing as in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.3 End-to-End Transformers: A Generic Architecture ‣ 2 Background ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The input audio is converted to suitable representation, often called spectrograms or mel spectrograms, to capture essential features of audio signals. The encoder processes these audio feature representations to capture the contextual or longer-term dependency in speech signals. The attention mechanism plays a critical role in speech-processing tasks such as speaker identification, emotion recognition, and speech translation, where understanding the broader context is crucial. They allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the speech signal, handling long-range dependencies.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, speech-based multi-head self-attention enables the model to simultaneously capture various aspects of the speech signal, such as phonetic content, speaker characteristics, and prosodic features. This processing capability is vital in dealing with speech’s complex and varied nature. Additionally, positional encoding ensures that the model recognizes and preserves the order of the audio features. The output of this attention mechanism is then processed by a decoder that uses a feed-forward network to generate the next word or phoneme. Its output is further passed through the activation function, generating probability distribution over a vocabulary of possible phonemes or words for the next token in the sequence. This model employs different strategies to select the most probable token at each step during inference. The generated output is based on the application, such as textual transcriptions of the spoken content for speech recognition and audio waveform for speech synthesis. It effectively bridges the gap between between acoustic signals and linguistic content. Further, this encoding-decoding mechanism is coupled with pre-training and fine-tuning to adapt to diverse speech datasets or applications. These key modifications have led to significant advancement in various speech processing applications such as IVR, voice assistants, and mobile streaming ASR<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, introducing novel models such as Emformer<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, Biencoder Transformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, Squeezeformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, Branchformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, LFEformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> or Speechformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and modification as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> achieved a notable result of 10.9% WER on speech recognition benchmark dataset WSJ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, with addition of convolution layers which downsamples long audio sequences in transformers.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This paper focuses on advancing the research and innovation of ASR capabilities for diverse languages, specifically for low-resource or endangered languages.
The need for lingualism in ASR arises from bridging the communication gap, cross-cultural divergence, technology readiness, business growth, and development with advancement in linguistic, sociolinguistic, and computational linguistic research. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the ability of ASR systems to handle multiple languages efficiently becomes more crucial.
To solve this, we propose a structured hierarchy to incorporate the aspect of lingualism in ASR, as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.4 End-to-End Transformer Architecture: for Speech Processing ‣ 2 Background ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

From an ASR perspective, lingualism involves integrating multilingual capabilities into systems to enhance functionality. A monolingual ASR system should accurately transcribe speech from a single language. In contrast, bilingual or multilingual ASR systems must recognize and transcribe users’ unique language, even when multiple languages are present in a single audio source <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Bilingual and multilingual speakers often exhibit intra-sentential and inter-sentential code-switching, shifting between languages within sentences or at discourse boundaries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. By integrating multiple languages and utilizing transfer learning, lingual ASR systems achieve improved speech recognition performance, effective code-switching handling, and enhanced accessibility for multilingual communities. Subsequent subsections will delve into recent advancements in monolingual, bilingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual ASR systems.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent trends have shown considerable progress in developing noise-robust ASR systems. Initially, a two-pass approach involving speech enhancement followed by speech recognition was common. However, researchers have observed that different noise types, such as non-stationary noise, require specific model-adaptation techniques for effective performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has also become crucial in ASR, especially for conformer models, which initially suffered from slow performance. Various optimization techniques have been proposed to enhance these models’ efficacy, making them more suitable for real-world applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
A novel approach in modular end-to-end ASR systems combines acoustics-to-phoneme and phoneme-to-word networks, effectively addressing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. This method demonstrates the potential of semi-supervised approaches in leveraging unlabeled data for ASR development.
Integrating transformers with CNNs, the conformer model emerged as a significant advancement in ASR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Despite its initial slow performance, subsequent studies focused on various optimization techniques, significantly improving its efficiency and applicability in streaming applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
Noise-robust ASR systems, essential for real-life scenarios, necessitate large training datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Comprehensive comparisons of speech enhancement and model-adaptation techniques have been conducted, providing insights into improving noise robustness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Additionally, a gradient remedy approach has been adopted to enhance noise robustness in ASR systems further <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
The lack of labelled data highlights the need for semi-supervised approaches in low-resource languages. Self-training methods in seq-to-seq models have substantially improved, utilizing large unlabeled datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
Reinforcement learning has been explored as an effective method for speech enhancement, particularly using noisy-clean pair datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. This approach and a fully convolutional method for end-to-end systems signify a growing interest in innovative techniques to predict text from raw waveform data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.
These advancements in monolingual ASR using deep learning, transformers, and reinforcement learning have overcome challenges in ASR, such as noise robustness and low-resource language processing. These developments depend on resources such as corpus, language, acoustic features, and novel architecture, leading to performance measures offering the system’s efficiency to be usable. We further brief each of these in the section one by one.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of monolingual end-to-end transformer ASR systems, as detailed in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Monolingual Models ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, specific datasets have emerged as popular choices for ASR. The Librispeech dataset, being the largest publicly available English corpus, is used most frequently, featured in 29.2% of the studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. AISHELL, a prominent Mandarin dataset, follows with a usage rate of 12.5% <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>.

These datasets vary in size, ranging from 50 hours to 60,000 hours. Our research findings, including dataset utilization, are summarized in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3 Monolingual Models ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and graphically presented in Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 3.1 Datasets and Languages ‣ 3 Monolingual Models ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. English is the predominant language in monolingual ASR research, accounting for 64.3% of studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. Mandarin follows with 17.9% usage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>.

Librispeech, with its extensive English dataset, has been instrumental in achieving some of the lowest Word Error Rates (WER) in ASR, around 2% from our analysis. AISHELL is a key resource for Mandarin ASR, with various versions like AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 offering 170 and 2000 hours of data, respectively. To enhance noise robustness in ASR systems, researchers often incorporate noisy datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. They are additionally augmenting smaller datasets to prevent overfitting, primarily through techniques like SpecAugment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, speed perturbation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>, and length perturbation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, has proven effective in improving ASR performance. We urge, <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">benchmarking of datasets</span> specifically to English and Mandarin, with a growing need call for low-resource language datasets with acoustic variability to enhance the robustness of ASR.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In monolingual ASR, extracting and representing acoustic features are pivotal steps in processing speech signals. These features capture the essential characteristics of speech, enabling acoustic models to perceive and interpret the audio data accurately. Our analysis, is summarized in Table <a href="#S3.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 3 Monolingual Models ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, indicates a dominant preference for filterbank features, utilized in 76% of the research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. The remaining 23% of studies employ Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. These feature extractors typically operate in 40-dimensional and 80-dimensional spaces. Features are normalized using mean and variance normalization to improve the system robustness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. MFCC works well in clean speech environments. By dividing audio signals into small frame-based segments, MFCC captures crucial spectral properties. However, its performance tends to decrease in noisy conditions. Filterbank features are increasingly preferred due to their direct representation of energy within frequency bands, avoiding the additional processing steps inherent in MFCC extraction. Their simplicity and efficiency make them ideal for real-time processing and tasks requiring high computational efficiency. Recent trends indicate a growing preference for filter bank features over MFCCs in monolingual ASR systems.</p>

In terms of acoustic feature dimensions, transformers are applied to 40- and 80-dimensional features, whereas conformers are specifically associated with 80-dimensional features. Conformers have demonstrated approximately 2% WER on the standard 960-hour Librispeech dataset<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Decoding involves the selection of the most likely word sequence from the acoustic input, guided by language model probabilities. In monolingual ASR, our survey identifies two primary decoding mechanisms: beam search and greedy search. Beam search decoding, noted for its effectiveness in finding more accurate word sequences, is employed in several studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S3.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The performance of monolingual ASR systems is predominantly evaluated using Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER). WER is the more widely used metric, featured in 83.3% of the surveyed studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>. It calculates the proportion of words the ASR system incorrectly identifies against a standard reference transcription, calculating word-level accuracy. On the other hand, CER, assessing errors at the character level, is used in 16.7% of the research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent advancements in bilingual ASR systems have focused extensively on addressing code-switching and code-mixing scenarios, which are prevalent in bilingual speech. A significant challenge in this area is the scarcity of dedicated code-switching datasets. Researchers have tackled this issue by either leveraging existing monolingual datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>, <a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>, <a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>, <a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite> or augmenting them to simulate code-switching scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite>. However, fine-tuning models for code-switched speech often leads to degraded performance in monolingual ASR. A plausible solution could be the Learning Without Forgetting (LWF) framework, which helps maintain monolingual accuracy while improving code-switching performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite>, the study addresses the challenge of intra-sentential code-switching, which affects the performance of monolingual speech. The research aims to preserve monolingual accuracy while enhancing code-switching speech recognition. Another critical issue is the reliance on language-dependent resources, prompting the need for ASR systems that minimize handcrafted inputs. Transformers have been helpful in bilingual ASR, particularly for handling code-switching where language switching occurs inter-sententially <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>, <a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite>. These models are favoured for their fast inference and parallel computation capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>, <a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>, <a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>]</cite>, end-to-end attention-based ASR systems modifications include incorporating language identity information, workpiece models and transfer learning to handle bilingual speech effectively. This approach is particularly relevant for voice-assistant devices that require compact ASR models. Additionally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>]</cite> explores the Transformer-transducer model for leveraging code-switching text data, addressing data scarcity in bilingual ASR tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>]</cite>. CTC-based models have been a popular choice for bilingual ASR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite>. However, recent studies have shifted towards more sophisticated models like the non-auto regressive CTC-attention model proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite>, which offers improved recognition accuracy and faster decoding. Hybrid models that combine supervised DNNs with i-vector feature extraction and phonological analysis have also shown promising results in enhancing ASR performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>, <a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite>. Moreover, with the growing demand for voice-assistant-enabled devices, the need for streaming-based, memory-efficient ASR models has been addressed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite>. The Bi-lingual ASR system has significantly progressed with deep learning and transformer models. These models can handle code-switching scenarios, optimize models for fast inference, and can streamline systems.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our investigation into recent bilingual ASR research reveals various acoustic features employed across various studies. This analysis, detailed in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 4.2 Acoustic Features ‣ 4 Bi-lingual Models ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, provides an insightful overview of the acoustic features predominantly used in this field. The most predominant acoustic features are MFCC, Filterbank, Pitch, and i-vector. MFCC is emerging as the most extensively used acoustic feature. It is employed in 40.0% of the bilingual ASR studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>, <a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>, <a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>, <a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite>. Its widespread adoption can be attributed to its effectiveness in capturing the key spectral properties of speech. The filter bank is the second most utilized feature, found in 32.0% of the research<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>, <a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>, <a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>, <a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>, <a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>, <a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. This feature is known for its ability to provide a comprehensive representation of the speech signal, making it highly suitable for ASR tasks. Pitch and i-vector features, accounting for 12% and 16% of usage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>, <a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>, <a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>, <a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite>, in bilingual ASR. Pitch features are crucial in capturing the prosodic aspects of speech, while i-vectors are instrumental in speaker and language recognition tasks within ASR systems.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our analysis of recent bilingual ASR studies highlights the prominent metrics as WER, MER, CER, and Token Error Rate (TER). The WER is the most widely adopted metric in bilingual ASR research; WER is employed in over 50% of the studies. It is attributed to its effectiveness in quantifying word recognition accuracy in speech, particularly in languages where the word is a significant unit of meaning. The MER is utilized in 20% of the research; MER emerges as a vital metric, especially in scenarios where bilingual ASR systems handle languages with differing linguistic structures. The CER and TER metrics are used less frequently than MER. CER is particularly relevant for character-based languages like Mandarin, where the accuracy of character recognition is more indicative of ASR performance than word recognition. In contrast, TER provides an alternative measure focusing on the accuracy of token recognition, which can be crucial in mixed-language scenarios.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Multilingual ASR systems have seen substantial improvements by integrating various transformer-based models.

Furthermore, phoneme-based methods, which are crucial in ASR as an intermediary step and have demonstrated drastic performance improvements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>, <a href="#bib.bib90" title="" class="ltx_ref">90</a>, <a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>, <a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>, <a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">91</a>, <a href="#bib.bib92" title="" class="ltx_ref">92</a>, <a href="#bib.bib93" title="" class="ltx_ref">93</a>]</cite>.

Additionally, the use of sequence-to-sequence, LSTM, and transliteration models at various stages of ASR (acoustic modelling, decoding, and language modelling) has also been explored <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>, <a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>, <a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>]</cite>. The dataset’s size and linguistic information play a critical role in multilingual training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib94" title="" class="ltx_ref">94</a>]</cite>. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">91</a>]</cite> found that phonetically related languages perform better in multilingual ASR systems compared to phonetically unrelated languages. This insight is crucial for training models on diverse language sets.
Phoneme-based approaches have been at the forefront of multilingual ASR research due to their ability to leverage similarities across languages. Foundational speech models in these systems enhance performance significantly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>, <a href="#bib.bib92" title="" class="ltx_ref">92</a>, <a href="#bib.bib93" title="" class="ltx_ref">93</a>, <a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>]</cite>. Before transformer architecture, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is performed to robustify the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>, <a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>]</cite>. The investigation of phone-based Byte Pair Encoding (PBPE) for various language families further strengthens these findings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib92" title="" class="ltx_ref">92</a>]</cite>.
Innovations like the <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">transformer transducer based streamable ASR </span> model, as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>]</cite>, are based on a self-attention architecture with language identification (LID) capabilities. These models address the challenges of varying input sizes, which can create an imbalance in multilingual ASR systems.
The bert-CTC transducer model, as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib98" title="" class="ltx_ref">98</a>]</cite>, outperforms the simpler bert-CTC model. This advancement indicates a significant step forward in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of multilingual ASR systems.
The multilingual ASR is advancing rapidly with the adoption of transformer-based models, phoneme-based approaches, and architectures like the bert-CTC transducer. These developments are crucial in addressing the unique challenges posed by multilingual speech processing, particularly in enhancing model performance for low-resource languages and managing the complexity of diverse phonetic structures.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In multilingual ASR systems, datasets vary in size, language composition, and domain, each contributing uniquely to developing robust ASR systems. Our analysis, summarized in Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 5 Multi-lingual ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and depicted in Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 5.1 Datasets and Languages ‣ 5 Multi-lingual ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, highlights recent multilingual ASR studies’ most commonly used datasets.
The Commonvoice dataset, which has 38 languages, was most commonly utilized in 11.1% of the research works (cited in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib99" title="" class="ltx_ref">99</a>, <a href="#bib.bib100" title="" class="ltx_ref">100</a>, <a href="#bib.bib101" title="" class="ltx_ref">101</a>, <a href="#bib.bib92" title="" class="ltx_ref">92</a>]</cite>). Followed by the Multilingual Librispeech dataset (7.4% usage, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib105" title="" class="ltx_ref">105</a>, <a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite>), Google’s voice search dataset (5.6% usage, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>, <a href="#bib.bib103" title="" class="ltx_ref">103</a>]</cite>), and the Nordics dataset (3.7% usage, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>]</cite>). Other datasets include BABEL (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib101" title="" class="ltx_ref">101</a>]</cite>), Fluers, TED-LIUM (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib100" title="" class="ltx_ref">100</a>]</cite>), and a wide range of corpora such as CSJ, AISHELL, NCHLT, MCV, IARPA MATERIAL, OpenASR21, LJSpeech (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib90" title="" class="ltx_ref">90</a>]</cite>), and Globalphone (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>, <a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">91</a>]</cite>). These datasets vary in size, ranging from 120 hours to a massive 150k hours (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">108</a>]</cite>). However, data size variations often lead to imbalances, with languages having larger data volumes typically demonstrating better model performance (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib99" title="" class="ltx_ref">99</a>]</cite>). To address this challenge, noisy datasets are often incorporated into model training, aiding in developing noise-robust ASR systems (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>, <a href="#bib.bib93" title="" class="ltx_ref">93</a>]</cite>). Data augmentation techniques are also employed to expand dataset sizes, consequently enhancing model generalization (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib107" title="" class="ltx_ref">107</a>, <a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">108</a>, <a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>]</cite>). This dataset encompasses a broad spectrum of languages and acoustic conditions, providing a rich training ground for models to learn and adapt.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our analysis sheds light on the predominant acoustic features employed in recent multilingual ASR research. MFCC is the most frequently used feature employed in 39% of the studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>, <a href="#bib.bib102" title="" class="ltx_ref">102</a>]</cite>. They are known for their ability to mimic the human ear’s response to different frequencies, thereby offering an efficient way to represent speech in ASR systems. Filterbank features are used in 27.3% of the research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>, <a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite>. These features comprehensively represent the frequency bands within the speech signal, making them a valuable asset in multilingual ASR systems. Mel Spectrogram, another key acoustic feature, is employed in 21.7% of the studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib111" title="" class="ltx_ref">111</a>, <a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>, <a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">108</a>]</cite>. This feature represents the short-term power spectrum of sound and is particularly effective in capturing the intricate variations in speech across different languages. Pitch features, which convey information about the speech’s tone and intonation, are utilized in 8.7% of the research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>, <a href="#bib.bib101" title="" class="ltx_ref">101</a>]</cite>. These features are particularly useful in distinguishing linguistic nuances across languages. Finally, i-vector features, accounting for 4.3% of the usage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">91</a>]</cite>, are often combined with either filterbank or MFCC features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">91</a>, <a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>, <a href="#bib.bib101" title="" class="ltx_ref">101</a>]</cite>. I-vectors provide a compact representation of speaker and channel characteristics, enhancing the model’s ability to adapt to different speakers and recording conditions in a multilingual context.</p>

<div id="S5.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are predominately four metrics used to evaluate multilingual ASR: WER, CER, Phoneme Error Rate (PER), and MER. WER is mostly used in Indo-European languages. Research shows that WER is a reliable metric for evaluating ASR performance in languages with a syntactic structure similar to English <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib106" title="" class="ltx_ref">106</a>, <a href="#bib.bib107" title="" class="ltx_ref">107</a>]</cite>. CER For languages like Chinese and Japanese, where word delimitation is not space-based, CER becomes a more appropriate metric. Studies employing CER focus on the character-level accuracy of ASR systems, crucial for handling logographic scripts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite>. This metric provides insights into the system’s precision in transcribing each character, a critical aspect of accuracy in these languages. PER is used for phoneme recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>]</cite>, especially in languages with complex phonemic structures. It measures the system’s capability to accurately identify and transcribe individual phonemes, which is particularly challenging in multilingual contexts with diverse phonetic systems. MER is employed in studies that tackle the challenge of language diversity within a single ASR system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib106" title="" class="ltx_ref">106</a>]</cite>. This metric combines WER, CER, and PER elements to provide a more holistic evaluation of ASR systems operating on languages with varying structural features.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Cross-lingual ASR systems have evolved significantly, addressing unique challenges through diverse training approaches and deep learning techniques. These advancements are particularly crucial in managing the complexities associated with cross-lingual speech recognition, especially in low-resource language settings. The <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">training methodologies for cross-lingual ASR</span> systems span a broad spectrum from supervised to unsupervised methods. A prominent supervised approach involves phoneme-based training for knowledge transfer. Notable works in this area include the development of a phone inventory for unseen languages, leading to the creation of universal phone-to-articulatory mappings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>]</cite>. These efforts aim to bridge the gap between languages and improve the system’s ability to adapt to new linguistic contexts. Studies like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib117" title="" class="ltx_ref">117</a>]</cite> suggest that extracting diverse <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">learning representations from raw waveform</span> can significantly enhance knowledge transfer. This concept is further explored in works like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>]</cite>, which delve into the intricacies of unsupervised learning and its application in cross-lingual ASR. Recent advancements have also been made in <span id="S6.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data injection into phone language models</span>, especially in few-shot settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">120</a>, <a href="#bib.bib117" title="" class="ltx_ref">117</a>]</cite>, along with iterative <span id="S6.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pseudo-labeling</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">121</a>]</cite>, phone sequence decipherment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib122" title="" class="ltx_ref">122</a>]</cite>, and cross-lingual self-training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>]</cite>. These methods aim to enhance the model’s capability to handle a variety of linguistic inputs and improve accuracy in cross-lingual contexts. The introduction of<span id="S6.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic"> meta-learning methods</span>, as seen in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">124</a>]</cite>, addresses the issue of full-model adaptation, which is computationally intensive. The proposed meta-adapter offers a solution with faster computation and fewer parameters, making it suitable for <span id="S6.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-lingual adaptation</span>, particularly in low-resource scenarios. In the domain of unsupervised transformers, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>]</cite> emphasizes the use of<span id="S6.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic"> Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)</span>, utilizing pre-trained phoneme representations from a source language and applying them to target languages. This approach underscores the importance of leveraging existing linguistic knowledge to facilitate learning in new language environments. Deep learning plays a pivotal role in the development of cross-lingual ASR systems. Techniques like <span id="S6.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data injection</span>, <span id="S6.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">iterative pseudo-labeling</span>, <span id="S6.p1.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">decipherment</span>, and <span id="S6.p1.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">knowledge distillation</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib126" title="" class="ltx_ref">126</a>, <a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">120</a>, <a href="#bib.bib122" title="" class="ltx_ref">122</a>]</cite> have been crucial in overcoming the challenges associated with low-resource languages and enhancing the overall efficacy of ASR systems.
A critical challenge identified in cross-lingual ASR is <span id="S6.p1.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">overfitting</span>, especially in low-resource language contexts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">127</a>]</cite>. Addressing this issue is key to developing robust and adaptable ASR systems that efficiently handle a wide range of linguistic inputs. The field of cross-lingual ASR integrates advanced training methods, deep learning techniques, and unsupervised learning approaches to overcome the challenges.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The advancement of ASR in cross-lingual contexts heavily relies on diverse datasets that cover a broad spectrum of languages and dialects. This section delves into the significant datasets and languages employed in cross-lingual ASR research, highlighting the challenges and trends in dataset usage and language coverage.
<span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Commonvoice dataset</span> is a prominent resource in multilingual ASR research, offering a substantial collection of 2500 hours of speech data across 38 languages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib140" title="" class="ltx_ref">140</a>, <a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">124</a>, <a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>, <a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>, <a href="#bib.bib130" title="" class="ltx_ref">130</a>, <a href="#bib.bib129" title="" class="ltx_ref">129</a>]</cite>. Commonvoice is characterized by its extensive language diversity and substantial participant involvement, making it a valuable asset for cross-lingual studies. <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Librispeech</span> focused on English, this dataset comprises 1000 hours of read speech sampled at 16kHz, primarily sourced from public audio domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib141" title="" class="ltx_ref">141</a>, <a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>, <a href="#bib.bib129" title="" class="ltx_ref">129</a>]</cite>. Its large volume and high-quality recordings are crucial for English-centric or multilingual studies involving English. <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IARPA Babel</span>, is towards conversational speech; the Babel dataset includes ten Asian and African languages. It provides audio recordings in real-life scenarios and diverse acoustic conditions. The dataset offers two configurations: the Full Language Pack (FLP) with 80 hours and the Limited Language Pack (LLP) with 10 hours of speech, making it suitable for resource-constrained language studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib142" title="" class="ltx_ref">142</a>, <a href="#bib.bib130" title="" class="ltx_ref">130</a>, <a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">127</a>, <a href="#bib.bib129" title="" class="ltx_ref">129</a>, <a href="#bib.bib117" title="" class="ltx_ref">117</a>]</cite>. Globalphone, a less common but significant dataset, covers 20 languages in 4000 hours, half of which are from native speakers. It has been a valuable source in cross-lingual research, especially for languages underrepresented in other datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib143" title="" class="ltx_ref">143</a>, <a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>, <a href="#bib.bib129" title="" class="ltx_ref">129</a>, <a href="#bib.bib131" title="" class="ltx_ref">131</a>]</cite>. Japanese Corpus, consisting of 2500 hours of Japanese speech, including JSUT, LTVS, and JNAS, is one of the largest for a single language. It is complemented by additional datasets like CGN and Aidatatang 200zh, providing extensive resources for Japanese-centric ASR research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib134" title="" class="ltx_ref">134</a>, <a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>]</cite>. Our analysis in Table <a href="#S6.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ 6 Cross-lingual ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> shows that the total number of languages covered in source and target configurations are 79 and 57, respectively. English is predominantly a source language, while Spanish is a frequent target. This dataset size and language diversity imbalance often leads to model biases, particularly towards well-represented languages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">120</a>]</cite>. Recent research has explored various language pair combinations, including one-to-one <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>, <a href="#bib.bib132" title="" class="ltx_ref">132</a>]</cite>, one-to-many <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib137" title="" class="ltx_ref">137</a>, <a href="#bib.bib131" title="" class="ltx_ref">131</a>]</cite>, and many-to-many <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib122" title="" class="ltx_ref">122</a>]</cite> configurations. These studies have shown significant improvements in ASR performance, especially for low-resource languages, demonstrating the field’s growing capability to accommodate and enhance speech recognition across various linguistic contexts. The diverse range of datasets allows researchers to tackle challenges associated with low-resource languages, dialectal variations, and acoustic diversity.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">6.2 </span>Acoustic Features</h3>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Cross-lingual systems handle a diverse range of phonetic and prosodic characteristics. We review and summarize the usage and impact of various acoustic features in cross-lingual ASR tasks, as represented in Table <a href="#S6.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ 6.3 Architecture-model and Decoding ‣ 6 Cross-lingual ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.
The most prominently used acoustic features in cross-lingual ASR are MFCC, Filterbank, Pitch, Bottleneck, and I-vector features. MFCC works well in clean speech environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib144" title="" class="ltx_ref">144</a>, <a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>, <a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">127</a>, <a href="#bib.bib129" title="" class="ltx_ref">129</a>, <a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>, <a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>]</cite>. By dividing audio signals into small frame-based segments, MFCC captures crucial spectral properties. However, its performance tends to decrease in noisy conditions. Filterbank features are increasingly preferred due to their direct representation of energy within frequency bands, avoiding the additional processing steps inherent in MFCC extraction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib134" title="" class="ltx_ref">134</a>, <a href="#bib.bib135" title="" class="ltx_ref">135</a>, <a href="#bib.bib136" title="" class="ltx_ref">136</a>]</cite>. Their simplicity and efficiency make them ideal for real-time processing and tasks requiring high computational efficiency. Recent trends indicate a growing preference for filter bank features over MFCCs in cross-lingual ASR systems. Pitch features capture speech prosody and intonation, particularly the fundamental frequency (F0), essential in cross-lingual ASR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">124</a>, <a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite>. These features extract a time series of pitch values per frame, enhancing ASR accuracy by incorporating prosodic information, speaker characteristics, and effective segmentation. Bottleneck features are less commonly used and play a significant role in speaker identification and verification, utilizing the vocal characteristics unique to individuals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib145" title="" class="ltx_ref">145</a>]</cite>. I-vector features are crucial for speaker verification, offering a compact representation of speaker characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>]</cite>. Their usage, however, is less frequent compared to other features. There has been a notable shift towards filterbank features in recent years due to diverse linguistic environments and computational resources. The increased adoption of filterbank features reflects the evolving landscape of ASR technology, where the focus is not just on accuracy but also on adaptability and efficiency, especially in multilingual and diverse acoustic scenarios.</p>

The decoding algorithm integrates the outputs of the acoustic model and language model to determine the most likely transcription for the input audio. Several algorithms are commonly used for decoding in cross-lingual ASR, such as greedy search, beam search, Viterbi and CTC. Beam search is the most used decoding approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">124</a>, <a href="#bib.bib129" title="" class="ltx_ref">129</a>, <a href="#bib.bib131" title="" class="ltx_ref">131</a>]</cite>. It is a complex decoding algorithm that examines several options concurrently. It keeps a beam or group of candidates and selects the most likely candidates based on the total scores of the acoustic and language models. After the beam search, a greedy search was used. In greedy search, the most suitable phoneme, character, or word is chosen at each time step from the transcript, which makes it simpler <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib132" title="" class="ltx_ref">132</a>, <a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib136" title="" class="ltx_ref">136</a>]</cite>. Viterbi decoding is used in HMM-based systems, but in the end-to-end cross-lingual models, it is combined with CTC to perform decoding operations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib134" title="" class="ltx_ref">134</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S6.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">WER is the most commonly used metric, employed in about 70% of cross-lingual ASR research studies (referenced in works like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib129" title="" class="ltx_ref">129</a>, <a href="#bib.bib130" title="" class="ltx_ref">130</a>, <a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>, <a href="#bib.bib122" title="" class="ltx_ref">122</a>, <a href="#bib.bib126" title="" class="ltx_ref">126</a>]</cite>). Works like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib137" title="" class="ltx_ref">137</a>, <a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>, <a href="#bib.bib130" title="" class="ltx_ref">130</a>]</cite> have leveraged PER, particularly in studies where phonetic precision is crucial as it accurately transcribes phonetic elements, especially in multilingual contexts where phonetic structures vary significantly. While less commonly used than WER and PER, CER has gained increasing importance in recent research, as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib136" title="" class="ltx_ref">136</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The promising architecture of deep learning frameworks and transformers significantly impacts the advancement of speech or audio processing. We particularly focus on various levels of lingualism, especially for low-resource language requiring a multi-facet approach. To the best of our knowledge, we cover extensively all the state-of-art research based on the monolingual in section <a href="#S3" title="3 Monolingual Models ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, bi-lingual in section <a href="#S4" title="4 Bi-lingual Models ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, multilingual in section <a href="#S5" title="5 Multi-lingual ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and cross-lingual in section <a href="#S6" title="6 Cross-lingual ‣ Speech Recognition Transformers: Topological-lingualism Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. However, we still believe in the need for resources or scarcity of resources to build ASR for low-resource languages. This linguality perspective, explored in this paper, faces many key challenges and opens the avenue for further research in this domain.</p>

<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Large scale requirement of data or handling low-resource languages</span> In ASR, the emergence of transformer-based architectures has highlighted a pivotal challenge: their significant dependence on large volumes of training data. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> indicate that the performance of ASR models is proportionate to the training corpus size. This correlation is particularly evident across diverse lingualism spectrum’s, including monolingual, bilingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual systems. However, the availability of such large-scale datasets is predominantly limited to widely-spoken languages, such as English and Mandarin, leaving a gap in resources for low-resource languages. Collecting and annotating substantial speech data for these languages present significant challenges<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. This challenge could be mitigated by transcribing audio across multiple languages, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib130" title="" class="ltx_ref">130</a>]</cite>, which seems much more challenging than compiling a monolingual dataset. To mitigate these challenges, the most prominent solution is the generation of synthetic data from existing datasets using advanced data augmentation techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>]</cite>, including speech perturbation, volume perturbation, audio-splicing, noise injection, and pitch shifting, which are key techniques for increasing the diversity and size of the training corpus.
Another direction could be the compilation of multilingual datasets from various sources, followed by model training using weak supervision methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib100" title="" class="ltx_ref">100</a>]</cite>. These techniques enable the efficient utilization of available data while addressing the scarcity of large annotated datasets. Transfer learning is another strategic approach where models pre-trained on extensive datasets are adapted to smaller, specific datasets. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>]</cite>, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of models tailored for low-resource languages. Moreover, applying multitask learning paradigms, where a model is trained concurrently on multiple tasks, can significantly enrich its linguistic capabilities and adaptability. Integrating semi-supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies, where transcription of input data is not mandatory, offers a path forward in scenarios of limited annotated data availability. These approaches, as discussed by<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib136" title="" class="ltx_ref">136</a>]</cite>, are gaining traction as viable alternatives to traditional supervised learning methods in ASR.

Future research in ASR, particularly concerning low-resource languages, requires the benchmark for dataset volume required for efficient model training. Such benchmarks, as proposed by<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">121</a>]</cite>, would provide a framework for developing more targeted and effective ASR systems, facilitating progress in this field and linguistic resources and technology.</p>

This rise in computational demands, compared to RNN training, requires the development of optimizers and learning rate schedulers. Specifically, the self-attention mechanism applied to speech poses quadratic computational complexity and does not convey specific meaning compared to words or lexical units. Rather, it complicates the computation of attentive weights. To address and enhance the self-attention mechanism for speech, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> adopts a pre-processing mechanism such as convolutions that group adjacent speech frames into meaningful units (phonemes). For longer speech sequences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib183" title="" class="ltx_ref">183</a>]</cite> propose time-restricted or truncated self-attention with<span id="S8.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic"> down sampling and pooling the audio</span>. The role of  positional encoding in transformers, crucial for capturing longer dependencies in sequential data, also poses challenges. The original sinusoidal position encoding can hinder performance in speech-based systems due to the extended length of sequences and may exhibit poor generalization in certain conditions. Various alternative approaches have been explored to address these issues in ASR, though further exploration is needed in other speech-related domains.
Their high computational cost contrasts the success of transformer-based end-to-end models in speech-related areas during <span id="S8.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">inference</span>, especially when compared to LSTM models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. The Transformer Transducer (T-T) model’s computational cost increases significantly with input sequence length, limiting its practical use. The subsequent development of the Conformer Transducer (C-T) aimed to improve T-T. Still, its non-streamability due to full-sequence attention in its encoder remains a limitation for streaming applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. Chen et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of s<span id="S8.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">treaming processing and early stopping</span> in reducing latency and runtime costs in speech models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, Lin et al. explored weight pruning, head pruning, low-rank approximation, and knowledge distillation to reduce model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib184" title="" class="ltx_ref">184</a>]</cite>. However, optimizing transformer models for different hardware platforms can introduce challenges like load imbalance, communication overhead, or memory fragmentation. Techniques for improving hardware utilization include tensor decomposition, kernel fusion, mixed precision arithmetic, and hardware-aware optimization
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib185" title="" class="ltx_ref">185</a>]</cite>. Addressing the self-attention mechanism’s quadratic complexity concerning sequence length has led to several proposed solutions, including sparse attention patterns, low-rank factorization, random feature maps, and locality-sensitive hashing. Additionally, transformers’ memory consumption, scaling linearly with sequence length and quadratically with hidden dimension size, poses significant challenges for large-scale data training and inference. Solutions such as reversible residual connections, gradient checkpointing, weight sharing, and parameter pruning have been suggested to manage memory usage.
Recent research has been directed toward optimizing transformer architectures across diverse lingual contexts to address these computational inefficiencies. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>, explored local-global context merging, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, focusing on reducing architectural parameters at the encoder or decoder levels which would increase the performance with lesser computational load. In monolingual ASR, methodologies such as downsampling audio signals have been investigated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, aiming to streamline the processing pipeline. Optimization efforts have been primarily concentrated at the decoding level for bilingual ASR systems to enhance efficiency without compromising the linguistic nuances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite>. Recent research has focused on architectural modifications for multilingual and cross-lingual models. This includes transitioning the convolutional layer structure to a more efficient 1-D format <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> and implementing Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models, which have shown potential in reducing training time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite>.
Additionally, byte-level input processing and optimizing batch sizes can be explored to enhance model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib107" title="" class="ltx_ref">107</a>]</cite>. Enhancing the efficiency of Transformers remains a key concern due to their large and complex architectures. Efforts to optimize efficiency involve using fewer training data and parameters, including strategies like knowledge distillation, model compression, asymmetrical network structures, and improved training sample utilization. Significant contributions in this regard include knowledge distillation, model simplification, weight-sharing, training with fewer samples, and compressing and pruning the model. These efforts highlight the ongoing importance of addressing efficiency in Transformer development. One of the possible solutions could be transfer learning. By leveraging models pre-trained on large datasets, researchers have efficiently fine-tuned these models for specific tasks, substantially reducing the training duration compared to training from scratch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite>. The knowledge captured in pre-trained models adapts to specific lingual contexts, demonstrating resource-efficient methodology for ASR model training. The necessity for substantial memory to store large-scale datasets and the model’s dense network parameters remains a substantial technical challenge. For future research, more work on the architectural level for model and efficient data storage and processing techniques could be explored to process low-resource and endangered language environments.</p>

<p id="S8.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Robustness challenge: handling noisy data and domain mismatch</span>
The ASR system trained on large-scale corpus has achieved impressive performance, surpassing the current state-of-art across various lingualism frameworks and its wide adoption to <span id="S8.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">down-streaming task</span>. However, the robustness of these models, especially in <span id="S8.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">noisy data environment</span> and <span id="S8.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">domain shifts </span>, is a key challenge<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">91</a>, <a href="#bib.bib103" title="" class="ltx_ref">103</a>, <a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>]</cite>.
For addressing issues related to noisy or distorted speech signals, <span id="S8.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">audio-visual ASR</span>, which leverages auditory and visual cues (such as lip movements) to improve recognition accuracy and robustness against background noise, could be a promising approach. It provides a novel direction for enhancing ASR system resilience; even conformer architecture could be utilized for this approach. Another crucial aspect adversely affecting ASR model performance is its dependence on <span id="S8.p4.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">raw speech features</span>, which makes them more exposed to noise inference and speaker variation. The lack of modelling of prosodic features such as rhythm, stress, and intonation in speech data impacts the performance. These variations are also caused by <span id="S8.p4.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">speakers and speaking style</span>, which calls for an unsupervised approach that learns speaker embeddings from raw speech using<span id="S8.p4.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic"> multi-task learning framework</span>, where speaker recognition and ASR task both are jointly optimized with contrastive loss. In the future, it calls for developing a robust and adaptable speech recognition model to address these challenges for diverse acoustic conditions, speaker variations, and a wide range of linguistic variations.
Models trained in a specific domain frequently perform poorly when confronted with audio from different domains. Addressing this <span id="S8.p4.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">domain mismatch</span> challenge involves advanced<span id="S8.p4.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic"> domain adaptation techniques</span>, including unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods. To overcome this, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>]</cite> have demonstrated significant progress, showcasing improvements over traditional supervised training methods. These models trained on mono-lingual face difficulty in adapting to other domains and generalize to another language, which degrades the performance. It also leads to the common issue in the ASR system of handling <span id="S8.p4.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words</span>, which often emerge from domain-specific terms, proper nouns, slang, or neologisms. To overcome this,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite> uses contrastive learning and focuses on training models using multiple languages with aligned linguistic features to enhance generalization in bilingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual ASR. The self-supervised technique enables the models to differentiate between similar and dissimilar speech segments. By using a multilingual phonetic vocabulary, these models can capture cross-lingual similarities, making transfer learning across different languages. Additionally, as we mentioned in the first challenge of large-scale data requirements, self-training and semi-supervised learning methods are used for unlabeled data, which enhances the quality of speech representations and would further improve performance by achieving state-of-the-art results for low-resource languages. Further research to enhance model adaptability to diverse acoustic and linguistic environments or real-world scenarios would bridge the gap in the research and usability of ASR applications.</p>

<p id="S8.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Generalization and Transferability Challenge</span>
One of the most prominent challenges of current ASR is its limitation to adapt to <span id="S8.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">new languages</span> or <span id="S8.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">domains</span> across a range of tasks and scenarios for diverse applications. This issue arises due to their dependence on extensive data for generalization, which might be biased. The dependence impacts the performance in downstream ASR, especially if the training data lacks a diverse set of examples or quality. To address this, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib186" title="" class="ltx_ref">186</a>]</cite> introduces the Bayesian Transformer Language Model (BTLM), which integrates a Bayesian framework to improve the model’s adaptability to out-of-domain speech data. The Bayesian Transformer employs variational inference to estimate latent parameter posterior distributions, which can effectively manage model uncertainty. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib184" title="" class="ltx_ref">184</a>]</cite> applies compression techniques such as weight pruning, head pruning, low-rank approximation, and knowledge distillation to transformer models. This strategy, especially with contrastive predictive coding (CPC), has shown enhanced performance in handling out-of-domain ASR tasks compared to traditional language models. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib187" title="" class="ltx_ref">187</a>]</cite> proposed Parallel Scheduled Sampling (PSS) and Relative Positional Embedding (RPE), which enhances robustness and mitigates exposure to bias by sampling tokens from either the ground truth or predicted sequences during training. By encoding relative distances between tokens, RPE improves the transformer’s capacity for processing long speech sequences. Despite the challenge of adapting to a new language, it is more difficult to keep up the pace of ever <span id="S8.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">evolving languages, slang</span> due to the dynamic nature of language. New slang, terms, and colloquialisms frequently emerge, which calls for <span id="S8.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dynamic language models</span> that can quickly adapt to evolving language use, perhaps through continuous online learning mechanisms. The transferability across different domains poses another challenge. To mitigate data augmentation, adversarial perturbation strategies, learning shared embedding spaces, and knowledge distillation could be utilized. In the case of multimodal ASR, there are distribution gaps between training and practical data, which induces difficulty in transferability. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib188" title="" class="ltx_ref">188</a>]</cite> presents the difficulty in transferring supervised multimodal transformers trained on well-aligned cross-modal pairs to weakly aligned test data. Further, adapting them to different tasks and different languages requires fine-tuning. It requires continual learning to enhance the versatility and efficacy in diverse linguistic and domain generalization and transferability.</p>

<p id="S8.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Multimodal Learning</span>
In ASR, capturing the nuances of speech beyond audio, such as visual cues from lip movement or facial expressions, potentially improves recognition accuracy in complex environments but also induces fusion challenges. The fusion strategy is prominently categorized into three levels: early, middle, and late fusion. Early fusion occurs at the input stage, combining different modalities before processing. Middle fusion involves merging intermediate representations of different modalities within the transformer’s attention mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This process might include direct integration of bimodal representations or more complex schemes such as alternating attention mechanisms across modalities. Late fusion, less common in MML ASR, focuses on combining the outcomes of separate modal pathways at the final prediction stage. Inspired by BERT’s success, early fusion in one-stream architectures requires handling modality-specific inputs with varied masking techniques. It poses a significant challenge in effectively processing distinct input types while maintaining the integrity of each modality’s information. Middle fusion, while offering more flexibility in combining modality-specific features at different network depths, demands sophisticated strategies to balance and adaptively combine these features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Another aspect of ASR is managing the intrinsic synchronization between modalities, such as audio and visual data, in audio-visual speech recognition. The challenge lies in aligning these modalities within the transformer framework to leverage the complementary information effectively. Apart from the technical challenges, they exhibit computational overheads, to overcome techniques such as bottlenecks token-based fusion aims to streamline this process but still requires careful consideration of computational resources. Additionally, optimizing these models for efficient training and inference, given the increased data and parameter load, remains a challenge.
As mentioned in the previous challenge, adapting these multimodal transformers to new domains or tasks within ASR, such as adapting a model trained on telephony speech to process audio from video conferencing, involves overcoming domain gaps. Techniques like data augmentation and adversarial training have been proposed to enhance model transferability, but effective implementation in ASR requires careful calibration to preserve speech-specific characteristics. Multiple research works use large-scale crawled web corpora or techniques like contrastive learning for cross-modal alignment in ASR, which introduces additional challenges. These include ensuring synchronization between audio and corresponding text or visual data and adapting these models for ASR-specific tasks.</p>

<p id="S8.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Language mismatch and code-mixing</span>
Cross-lingual ASR can process speech across different source and target languages. However, it becomes challenging for diverse pronunciations specifically, in handling the disparities in phonetic inventories, pronunciation norms, and language-specific characteristics<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>]</cite> and further explored by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>]</cite>. The problem grows with code-switching scenarios, where speakers alternate between languages within a single utterance. Further research could be explored while some studies delve into the challenges of developing robust language identification algorithms for such language shift scenarios.
Additionally, managing vocabulary and lexicon mappings between the source and target languages is critical, and it includes addressing differences in word choices, synonyms, idiomatic expressions, and specialized terminologies unique to each language. Handling these linguistic variations requires models to interpret and map these lexical disparities accurately.
To overcome continual learning and adapt to linguistic divergence, some studies use deep learning to improve accuracy in code-switched speech recognition, and incorporating multilingual training data into these models efficiently works. However, further research in code-mixing on improved language identification, robustness to the diverse acoustic environment, data-scarce scenarios, adaptability, semantic understanding, contextual processing, multilingual input integrations, personalizing, and bias mitigation could be explored.</p>

<p id="S8.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Personalisation and speaker variability</span>
Personalizing ASR through user-specific adaptation or individuals with unique speech patterns, accents, or speech impairments is a key area in the ASR domain. On the other hand, speaker variability which varies in a wide range of acoustic differences including <span id="S8.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">accent, speech rate, pronunciation, and speaking style</span> is the primary challenge in the performance degradation of ASR. Multiple research focuses on recognizing and transcribing speech considering these variations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. For bilingual ASR systems, the complexity is increased by the need to account for acoustic variations stemming from different languages, each with its unique<span id="S8.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic"> phonetic and prosodic</span> characteristics<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite>. These systems must recognize speech in two languages and adapt to the variations in accents, dialects, and individual speaker idiosyncrasies within each language. In the case of multilingual ASR systems, the challenge extends to a broader range of linguistic characteristics. Each language brings distinct acoustic properties influenced by its unique accents and dialects, requiring the ASR system to be versatile and adaptive across diverse linguistic spectra. Cross-lingual ASR systems are the toughest to be capable of handling acoustic variations not only within a single language but also across languages. This involves accurately modelling and adapting to the differences in <span id="S8.p8.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">accents, dialects, and speaker characteristics</span> prevalent in both the source and target languages, ensuring the system’s robustness in cross-lingual speech recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib146" title="" class="ltx_ref">146</a>]</cite>.
Further research on developing acoustic models that can adapt to speaker variability with diverse accents and dialects extract features from acoustic patterns. The complexity increases with non-standard speech patterns such as <span id="S8.p8.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">speech impairments, disfluencies and regional slang’s</span> and prosodic features such as rhythm, stress, and intonation in speech, which can be crucial for understanding and disambiguating spoken language. A key research gap is exploring <span id="S8.p8.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Paralinguistic features</span> specific to individual speaker characteristics such as pitch, volume, and speaking rate. This advancement also brings <span id="S8.p8.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ethical implications and privacy concerns</span> due to the use of personal and potentially sensitive speech data. This calls for investigating secure and privacy-preserving ASR methods, such as federated learning and differential privacy, to protect user data while maintaining model efficacy. This challenge is enhanced by using energy-efficient ASR models that operate through mobile or IoT devices or interactive ASR systems that can learn from user feedback in real time, adjust and improve based on user corrections and preferences.</p>

<div id="S9.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in various artificial intelligence tasks, largely due to the recent prevalence of the self-attention mechanism. This mechanism has been pivotal in capturing long-term dependencies, yielding phenomenal outcomes in speech processing and recognition tasks. However, a significant limitation of these end-to-end architectures is their reliance on large-scale datasets, which poses challenges for advancing ASR development in low-resource languages. This paper presents a groundbreaking comprehensive survey of transformer applications, particularly from a lingualism perspective in audio and speech processing. We’ve observed an emerging trend toward adopting transformers for the development of ASR systems in low-resource languages. The main insights from our study include: (1)<span id="S9.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">comparison of traditional and end-to-end ASR models</span>, as traditional ASR models require handcrafted features and often perform slowly due to their sequential nature. In contrast, recent end-to-end models use deep neural networks for transcribing audio into text, supporting parallel processing for significantly faster system performance. (2) <span id="S9.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">advancements in foundational models</span> employ self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, enabling training on hundreds to thousands of hours of data, including code-switching scenarios. Multilingual and cross-lingual models apply transfer learning techniques with these foundational models to assist low-resource languages by transferring knowledge from high-resource languages. (3) <span id="S9.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">speech datasets and augmentation techniques</span>, the Librispeech corpus is prominently used for monolingual, the Mandarin-English SEAME corpus for bilingual, and the Common Voice for multilingual models. A review of different speech datasets detailing the number of languages, duration, and availability is depicted. Various augmentation techniques like SpecAugment, noise injection, and speed and length perturbation are applied across mono, bi, multi, and cross-lingual models to enhance robustness. (4) <span id="S9.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">analysis of popular speech transformers</span>, their parameters, and their utilization in different lingualism techniques. (5) <span id="S9.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">we discuss challenges and future directions</span> such as computational requirements, robustness, generalization, language mismatch, and multimodal learning. Future research should focus on enhancing cross-lingual/multilingual systems and addressing the performance challenges identified in this review. These findings and recommendations aim to guide researchers and developers in the speech-processing field, particularly emphasising expanding the capabilities and accessibility of ASR systems for diverse linguistic contexts. This survey underscores the transformative impact of transformers in ASR and highlights the path forward for addressing the unique challenges in this domain.</p>
