<p id="id13.id1" class="ltx_p">Spoken language interaction is at the heart of interpersonal communication, and people flexibly adapt their speech to different individuals and environments. It is surprising that robots, and by extension other digital devices, are not equipped to adapt their speech and instead rely on fixed speech parameters, which often hinder comprehension by the user. We conducted a speech comprehension study involving 39 participants who were exposed to different environmental and contextual conditions. During the experiment, the robot articulated words using different vocal parameters, and the participants were tasked with both recognising the spoken words and rating their subjective impression of the robot’s speech. The experiment’s primary outcome shows that spaces with good acoustic quality positively correlate with intelligibility and user experience. However, increasing the distance between the user and the robot exacerbated the user experience, while distracting background sounds significantly reduced speech recognition accuracy and user satisfaction.
We next built an adaptive voice for the robot. For this, the robot needs to know how difficult it is for a user to understand spoken language in a particular setting. We present a prediction model that rates how annoying the ambient acoustic environment is and, consequentially, how hard it is to understand someone in this setting.
Then, we develop a convolutional neural network model to adapt the robot’s speech parameters to different users and spaces, while taking into account the influence of ambient acoustics on intelligibility. Finally, we present an evaluation with 27 users, demonstrating superior intelligibility and user experience with adaptive voice parameters compared to fixed voice.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There is the expectation that social robots will one day be capable of engaging in human-like spoken language interaction with people. However, achieving effective spoken interaction with devices such as robots and digital assistants presents a significant challenge, especially in environments with background noise and suboptimal acoustic properties. The parameters that govern a robot’s vocal characteristics—such as volume, speech rate, pitch, and emphasis—can impact speech intelligibility and the overall user experience <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Earlier research has underscored the detrimental effects of background noise on speech intelligibility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The reverberation time of a space, which strongly correlates with its acoustic quality, has been found to negatively affect speech intelligibility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Additionally, the distance between the listener and the sound source has a crucial impact on speech intelligibility and on the user experience<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Earlier studies have identified pitch, pitch range, volume, and speech rate as fundamental vocal characteristics conveying personality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. For instance, voice pitch has been effectively employed to model a robot’s personality and emotion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Speech speed influences speech intelligibility, and Jones <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> found that a faster speaking rate lowers comprehension for listeners <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Except for the critical role of acoustic factors, individual differences in listeners are also important. Different listeners vary in their ability to understand speech in noisy environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. As such, it is crucial to consider the listener’s personal information when designing the robot’s adaptivity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This work advances the field of data-driven adaptive speech, building upon a foundation of prior research that has explored various facets of the challenge, <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">which has distinct advantages, particularly when addressing complex, variable environments and tailoring individual user needs.</span> People adapt their speech during spoken conversation. This is known as the Lombard effect, which is an involuntary speech adaptation where speakers naturally modify their speech in noisy environments to improve communication. In response to loud environments, speakers will increase their speech volume, adjust pitch, and enunciate more, thus optimising interaction between interlocutors. However, robots lack this natural adaptability, highlighting the need for advanced systems to mimic the Lombard effect to improve human-robot interaction (HRI). Earlier studies have looked into adapting speech to noisy environments and the distance between the user and the robot <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, addressing the needs of individuals with hearing impairments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, or scaling the loudness of the voice dynamically when approaching a user <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Niculescu <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> find that pitch adaption of a robot’s voice impacted the users’ rating of overall interaction quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, most robots (and other interactive devices for that matter) do not take the acoustic properties of the environment, the ambient sound, or the user’s characteristics into account during the conversation. The large majority of spoken language interactions with robots use fixed voice parameters, often ignoring the dynamic nature of environmental and user factors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our study addresses three research questions (RQs) - RQ1: Is there a relationship between robot speech parameters, user characteristics, acoustic quality of the environment and ambient sound, and the robot’s intelligibility as well as user experience? RQ2: Can the robot use information about the environment and the user to adapt its speech parameters? RQ3: Can the robot’s speech parameters be dynamically adapted to optimise the user’s experience and the robot’s intelligibility?</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To reveal how ambient sound, the environment’s acoustic quality, the distance between the user and the robot, and the user’s hearing can affect both the robot’s intelligibility and the user’s experience, we first set up a data collection campaign. We used a speech recognition task using a paradigm from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The task relies on open-set recognition of four lists of English consonant-nucleus-consonant (CNC) monosyllabic words (e.g. <em id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">hash</em>, <em id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">dodge</em>, <em id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">should</em>, …) from the Northwestern University Auditory Test 6 (NU-6) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. The words were spoken by an NAO V5 humanoid robot (United Robotics Group, formerly known as Aldebaran Robotics). During the task, a recording of ambient sound (ranging from soft chatter to the sound of power tools) was played through a speaker placed near the robot. The voice parameters of the robot (i.e., volume, speech rate, pitch, and emphasis) were drawn using a uniform distribution from predetermined parameter ranges, thus sampling the voice parameter space.</p>

The volume ranges between [0, 2], and the pitch ranges between [0.5, 2], with a default of 1. Speed is set as a multiple of the default rate of 100%, ranging between [0.4, 4], and governs the pace at which the speech is articulated. Lastly, the <span id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">doubleVoiceLevel</span>, ranging between [0, 4], grants control over the gain of a second voice; 0 disables the effect.

To create an adaptive robot voice, we required a model to assess ambient sound annoyance. Then, we constructed an adaptive speech model that leverages the annoyance rating, and together with other parameters– the distance to the robot, the T30 reverberation of the room, the user’s English proficiency, and hearing difficulties– adjusts the robot’s speech parameters.</p>

In training, dropout and normalisation are used to prevent over-fitting of the model.
The Adam optimiser <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, with an initial learning rate of 0.005, minimises the loss function, with a batch size of 64. The model is trained for 100 epochs.
In inference, using a Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB GPU and Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2698 v4@2.20GHz as an example, the response time of the model from inputting acoustic features to outputting prediction results is 1.87<span id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p2.4.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ms</span>, which means the model can process input sounds in real-time.</p>

Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ III-A2 Ambient sound ARP model performance ‣ III-A Ambient sounds’ annoyance rating prediction ‣ III Building an adaptive robot voice ‣ No More Mumbles: Enhancing Robot Intelligibility through Speech Adaptation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> shows the performance of the proposed CNN-based ARP model on the test set, and also shows the performance of several other typical neural network models.
Among them, the deep neural network (DNN) consists of four fully connected (FC) layers and the ARP layer. Each FC layer’s number of units is 64, 128, 256, and 512, respectively. The final FC layer’s output is flattened and input to the ARP layer.
The Simple CNN consists of 4 convolutional layers, each equipped with (3 × 3) kernels, and the ARP layer. Each convolutional layer’s filter numbers are 64, 128, 256, and 512, respectively. The final convolutional layer’s output is flattened and input to the ARP layer.
The CNN-Transformer consists of 3 convolutional layers with (3 × 3) kernels, a Transformer encoder <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and the ARP layer.
In Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ III-A2 Ambient sound ARP model performance ‣ III-A Ambient sounds’ annoyance rating prediction ‣ III Building an adaptive robot voice ‣ No More Mumbles: Enhancing Robot Intelligibility through Speech Adaptation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, the results of the simple CNN are slightly better than those of the DNN, illustrating the effectiveness of the convolutional layer in extracting information such as the amplitude and frequency of ambient sounds from the input acoustic features. The CNN-Transformer, equipped with a Transformer encoder suited for temporal modelling, performs better than a simple CNN. Finally, the proposed CNN model achieved more competitive results with lower MSE and MAE. This shows that the proposed CNN-based ARP model can effectively predict the impact of ambient sound based on its comprehensive information on the participants.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our findings emphasise that it is crucial to tailor the robot’s voice to the specific environment to achieve both optimal speech intelligibility and a positive interaction experience for different users. We trained a neural network to predict optimal robotic voices based on user and environment characteristics. The network is trained only on data for which participant speech recognition was completely accurate and user satisfaction was greater than 5. This excludes data of negative user experiences or where the robot’s speech was poorly understood. We call this model the Environment-to-Voice model (ETV). It takes environmental factors as input, including annoyance ratings of ambient sound (reported by the ARP model), the distance to the robot, the English proficiency of the user, the user’s difficulty hearing in noisy environments, and the room’s acoustic quality. The model’s output consists of robot voice parameters, which consist of volume, speed, pitch, and emphasis.
The network has 5 input nodes, 2 hidden layers with a ReLU activation function (16 and 32 neurons, respectively) and a 4-neuron output layer with a linear activation function.

The ARP model is used to predict environmental annoyance ratings via the robot. Notably, due to the use of a lightweight model, the computation, despite running on the CPU, only requires 2 seconds. Subsequently, the predictions are communicated to a pre-trained ETV model. This predictive data, together with user-provided information on hearing difficulties and English proficiency and assessments of acoustic quality, serves as input for the ETV model, which then generates adaptive voice parameters.

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As expected, <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">there is a relationship between robot speech parameters, user characteristics, environment factors, and the robot’s intelligibility as well as user experience.</span> Specifically, we find that annoying sounds in the environment make it harder to understand the robot’s speech, which in turn hurts the user experience. This emphasises the need for adaptive robot speech in noisy settings. In addition, the room’s acoustic quality influences the intelligibility and the user experience, highlighting the need to take the room into account. Moreover, increased distance will worsen the user experience. Therefore, it might be interesting to further explore the proper distance for spoken conversation between a robot and its user. The results show that, as expected, the default and therefore nonadaptive robot voice will lead to subpar speech intelligibility and user experience when there is ambient sound in the environment. In brief, a robot voice that does not adapt to the user and the environment is a missed opportunity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the factors related to the user, unsurprisingly, English proficiency matters. People understand the English words spoken by the robot better when they are more proficient in English. Surprisingly, they report having a lower interaction experience, which we hypothesise might be explained by their having stricter pronunciation expectations for the robot. Similarly, the user’s hearing difficulties will exacerbate their understanding of the robot. These outcomes strongly suggest that user characteristics should be taken into consideration when setting the robot’s voice and speech parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As for robot speech parameters, a higher volume will help intelligibility, but worsen the user experience. Unsurprising, as shouting makes you heard, but it is not pleasant. Slow speech will improve both the user experience and the intelligibility. Surprisingly, robots with higher pitch values lead to poorer satisfaction and lower intelligibility. One possible explanation is that users may find sharp voices unpleasant or may not appreciate the emotional implications conveyed by higher pitch levels. For instance, earlier research noted that menacing voices often exhibit an increase in both volume and pitch. Additionally, increased pitch levels are commonly associated with expressions of anger <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Surprisingly, better emphasis —implemented through adding a double voice — had a small negative influence on both intelligibility and user experience. This effect could be attributed to the anomaly of emphasising a single word without a context.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Designing adaptive, user-centric robot systems that consider the individual user and environmental conditions is essential for effective communication in HRI. This requires the robot to be informed about the environment and the user, ideally in an automated way. The distance between the user and the robot was now manually entered into the model, but could, of course, be extracted from an RGBD camera. T30 reverberation estimates could also be approximated by the robot through speech <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> during the conversation or by playing an impulse sound when entering a new environment and analysing the reverberation. The ARP model predicts the impact of ambient noise. Other factors, such as the user’s language proficiency or potential hearing difficulties are harder to automatically extract but could be collected during the making of a user profile. <span id="S5.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In addition, from the evaluation experiment, we can conclude that the adaptive robot voice optimises the user’s experience and the robot’s intelligibility than its default voice.</span></p>

</h3>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study has certain limitations. First, the data we collected suffers from a class imbalance across predictors, as people with hearing difficulties or very low English proficiency levels are underrepresented. This imbalance can introduce bias into the model’s outcomes. Secondly, the participants may not be representative of the broader population, thus limiting the generalizability of the findings. Future studies could draw from a more diverse user population.
The experimental design, involving both within-subject and between-subject factors, introduces an additional complexity as not all group conditions for environmental factors are fully covered within the study. <span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In addition, even though the self-reported hearing difficulties or English levels has been used in previous research, it might still be influenced by individuals’s perception.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The speech recognition task relies on recognising single words, which is a difficult task. Embedding words in a sentence would improve intelligibility due to the availability of context. Our data was collected under controlled conditions, and a range of factors typical of real-world HRI scenarios, such as the presence of other speakers or contextual cues, were not taken into account. Our findings may not fully extend to more complex scenarios. However, it serves as a foundation for optimizing robots for more complicated scenarios.</p>

Finally, the position of the robot, whether on the left or right side of the participants, may influence their intelligibility of the robot’s speech.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S5.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given our results, it is difficult to understand why virtually all current robot voices do not adapt to the environmental context and the diversity in users. Our research sheds light on how adaptive voices can have a positive impact on both the user experience and speech intelligibility. Simply put, shouting louder to be better understood is not the solution. Instead, a judicious balance is needed between making the robot understood and not irritating the user.
In light of these, we presented the ETV model that seeks to enhance robot speech intelligibility by predicting and setting user-adapted and contextually suitable robot voice parameters, tailored to users, and to spatial and environmental conditions. Important to note is that the use of a data-driven model alleviates the need to use heuristics to change the robot’s voice.</p>
