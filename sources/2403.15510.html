<p id="id13.id1" class="ltx_p">Spoken language understanding (SLU), one of the key enabling technologies for human-computer interaction in IoT devices, provides an easy-to-use user interface. Human speech can contain a lot of user-sensitive information, such as gender, identity, and sensitive content. New types of security and privacy breaches have thus emerged. Users do not want to expose their personal sensitive information to malicious attacks by untrusted third parties. Thus, the SLU system needs to ensure that a potential malicious attacker cannot deduce the sensitive attributes of the users, while it should avoid greatly compromising the SLU accuracy. To address the above challenge, this paper proposes a novel SLU multi-task privacy-preserving model to prevent both the speech recognition (ASR) and identity recognition (IR) attacks. The model uses the hidden layer separation technique so that SLU information is distributed only in a specific portion of the hidden layer, and the other two types of information are removed to obtain a privacy-secure hidden layer. In order to achieve good balance between efficiency and privacy, we introduce a new mechanism of model pre-training, namely joint adversarial training, to further enhance the user privacy. Experiments over two SLU datasets show that the proposed method can reduce the accuracy of both the ASR and IR attacks close to that of a random guess, while leaving the SLU performance largely unaffected.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Voice-controlled IoT devices and smart home assistants are gaining popularity in people’s lives, and spoken language understanding (SLU) has become one of the main enabling technologies to achieve human-machine interaction between users and devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Coucke <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. For example, SLU can be found in the in-car voice system of Tesla electricity vehicles (EVs), the voice assistant of Apple phones and Xiaomi’s smart home ecology. Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Privacy-Preserving End-to-End Spoken Language Understanding" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(a) shows how these systems work in general.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are certain privacy risks associated with these IOT devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Atlam and Wills (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Due to their limited storage space, some vendors choose to deploy only the encoder of the model at the client side and transmit the output of the encoder to the server side for performing tasks such as prediction and classification, which gives opportunities for malicious attackers to take advantage of. Recent end-to-end SLU systems predict user intent directly from speech <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Serdyuk <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> (see also Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Privacy-Preserving End-to-End Spoken Language Understanding" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (b)). This approach circumvents the conversion of speech to text, and to a certain extent, it avoids privacy leakage caused by text theft. However, strictly speaking, end-to-end SLU systems are still subject to certain risks of privacy breach. As depicted in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Privacy-Preserving End-to-End Spoken Language Understanding" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(c), the recognition model may be vulnerable to being stolen by an untrusted third party and used to deduce the sensitive information about the user. In other words, to maintain sensitive user information, the SLU systems need to be able to infer the user’s intent from the masked voice only, while the specific voice content, identity information and other user-sensitive attributes should be dispensed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With the increasing public concern about the protection of personal privacy information and higher requirements of national standards on the protection of biological information, significant efforts have been invested to address the problem of user privacy leakage. The utilization of cryptography, multi-party secure computing, differential privacy, and federation learning has been widely investigated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, these methods have their own drawbacks. For example, using cryptography or differential privacy has a great impact on the classification accuracy of the model. Besides, the voice data being more complex leads to less efficient computation for multi-party secure computation, while under the federated learning, the end-side computation capability is limited. With the increasing refinement of deep learning methods, various new schemes are developed with adversarial training and disentangled representation being the more popular choices.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The current privacy-preserving intention understanding algorithms normally protect the voice print information of the speaker only, leaving the content information unprotected. From the perspective of privacy protection, this is not satisfactory. Intent understanding is usually used in the smart home and human-computer interaction scenarios, both of which use voice as the control signal. In those cases, wake-up words are sometimes used as a prompt for issuing instructions. When judging whether the speaker’s voice contains wake-up words, the system needs to record voice in real time, and then deduces the intent when it finds that there are wake-up words in the recorded voice. Nevertheless, the intent of the voice may also be recognized directly without using wake-up words. In this case, the recording will be longer than usual. If the speaker mentions something involving privacy during this time, the content of the voice would involve privacy information. Therefore, the privacy-preserving intention understanding algorithm needs to protect both the voice print and content information at the same time.</p>

Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Privacy-Preserving End-to-End Spoken Language Understanding" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> illustrates the developed privacy-preserving framework for SLU. First, we note that under the multi-task training, the information of the three tasks in consideration (i.e., SLU, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and identity recognition (IR)) in the encoder and hidden layers of the model would be entangled. This results in the attackers being potentially capable of inferring sensitive information for ASR as well as IR from the hidden layer output. We thus propose to partition the hidden layer of the model into several parts. The SLU task uses only one part of the hidden layer during training, while some other parts are reserved for ASR and IR processing. We further notice that there is some information similarity across the three considered tasks. The developed model is then augmented with the shared part in the hidden layer for the three tasks and the cosine similarity is utilized to impose isolation of the individual parts for the three tasks. With the above hidden layer separation, the information for SLU, ASR and IR are no longer mixed together. Instead, they occupy a separated part of the hidden layer. Specifically, only a specific part of the hidden layer contains useful information for SLU, but that part does not contain or contains only little information valuable for ASR and IR. This achieves the purpose of protecting privacy.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To further enhance the privacy preservation ability of the proposed model, two approaches are employed in the inference of the model. We 1) use robust ASR and IR attackers to reason about sensitive information, and we 2) train ASR and IR attackers from scratch under the premise of freezing the privatizer (encoder) and observe whether sensitive information can be recovered.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Early SLU tasks were carried out using two models. First, the speech sentences are input to the ASR model to obtain the text output, and then the text is input to the natural language unit (NLU) model for intent identification. However, this method is complex and difficult to tune. Thanks to the powerful abstraction capabilities of deep learning models, this solution is now gradually being replaced by the end-to-end SLU systems, which predict intent directly from the input speech fragments without going through generating intermediate text <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Serdyuk <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Haghani <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. In terms of model architecture, the end-to-end SLU framework has evolved from the original one that only uses classifiers to differentiate intent to one that uses ASR models for parameter initialization, complex models as feature extractors, and multi-task training with ASR to improve the classification accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Arora <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>

It can be expected that the information of three tasks will be mixed in the hidden layer of SH-PPSLU after the multi-task training, which can be captured by ASR and IR attackers to deduce the sensitive user information. On the other hand, the hidden layer part for SLU will not only contain the SLU information, but also will include a small amount of ASR and IR information. That is, the SLU part of the hidden layer has a better privacy protection capability, compared with the whole hidden layer.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Note that SH-PPSLU only reserves part of the hidden layer for SLU but this part still retains certain sensitive user information. This could be mitigated through employing the adversarial training to remove significant amount of private information. In this section of experiments, we present the privacy-preserving SLU with hidden layer separation (H-PPSLU), which completely separates the three tasks in the hidden layer. With this model, the part of hidden layer for SLU can have better privacy protection capability. The training process of H-PPSLU is as follows.</p>

First, the 80-dimensional Fbank features are extracted as low-dimensional feature inputs, and its frame length is 25ms with 10ms frame shift. In order to make the input size of the model match the selected data volume, We set the number of layers for Encoder and Decoder to be 12 and 6 respectively, and the attention dimension, number of header as well as droupout ratio to be 256, 4 and 0.1. Then, the individual part dimension of the SLU of the SH-PPSLU model is set to be 128, and the individual and shared part dimensions of the three tasks of the H-PPSLU model are both 64.
Our model is initialized with a 50-epoch trained ASR model weight. During the training process, the algorithms are trained for 15 epochs using Adam optimizer with the learning rate 0.001, and the coefficient of the ASR loss function 0.1.

It shows that the SLU classifier performs well in the test datasets only using a specific dimension feature in the hidden layer. When the model training is combined with adversarial training, it causes a small drop (two points) in the SLU performance, which is acceptable. We can also find that the SLU performance degradation is smaller using the FSC dataset than that using the SLURP dataset. Overall, our proposed model can maintain the performance of SLU well.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the actual attack scenario, the attacker can use more powerful attack means, that is, training the attack model from scratch, as shown in Scenario 2 in Figure 5. In addition, attackers generally do not know the data set used by our training model. For this reason, we use different training data (ASR: TED-LIUM, IR: TED-LIUM-I) to simulate the behavior of attackers.
We use the encoder model in the first test scenario for the test of the scenario 2. The IR classifier as well as ASR decoder are trained with random initialization. The test results can be seen in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results of Test Scenario II ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Privacy-Preserving End-to-End Spoken Language Understanding" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Under this attack, the attacker is able to obtain relatively high IR errors, but the accuracy of ASR is still maintained at a low level. We also find that the adversarial training further enhances the privacy-preserving ability of the hidden layer separation scheme. In other words, the hidden layer separation method also improves that of the adversarial learning. Overall, our model still has the better privacy protection capability under this attack.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a novel hybrid privacy-preserving algorithm that uses the hidden-layer feature separation and adversarial training framework for spoken language understanding. First, we divide the hidden layer into several parts according to the number of tasks, each of which occupies a shared and an individual part, and constrain the correlation between tasks by the cosine similarity, so that the individual information of different tasks is distributed in different parts of the hidden layer. Then, the adversarial training is utilized to further enhance the ability of privacy protection. It is shown that our method not only maintains the SLU accuracy without significantly degradation, but also reduces the success rate of attackers close to that of a random guess.</p>
