<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">The integration of visual cues has revitalized the performance of the target speech extraction task, elevating it to the forefront of the field. Nevertheless, this multi-modal learning paradigm often encounters the challenge of modality imbalance. In audio-visual target speech extraction tasks, the audio modality tends to dominate, potentially overshadowing the importance of visual guidance. To tackle this issue, we propose AVSepChain, drawing inspiration from the speech chain concept. Our approach partitions the audio-visual target speech extraction task into two stages: speech perception and speech production. In the speech perception stage, audio serves as the dominant modality, while visual information acts as the conditional modality. Conversely, in the speech production stage, the roles are reversed. This transformation of modality status aims to alleviate the problem of modality imbalance. Additionally, we introduce a contrastive semantic matching loss to ensure that the semantic information conveyed by the generated speech aligns with the semantic information conveyed by lip movements during the speech production stage. Through extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets for audio-visual target speech extraction, we showcase the superior performance achieved by our proposed method.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Speech serves as the primary means of exchanging and communicating information among humans. However, in real-world settings, speech signals often encounter contamination from various interfering factors, such as noise and irrelevant speakers. This scenario is commonly known as the “cocktail party problem” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bronkhorst (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2000</a>)</cite>. During actual conversations, perceivers possess the ability to selectively focus on specific acoustic stimuli, highlighting their inherent selective auditory attention. A long-term objective of speech processing research is to develop machines capable of emulating human auditory capabilities. These machines should be able to selectively extract the speech of a target speaker by utilizing auxiliary cues, such as reference speech <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Ge <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Mu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, static facial images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gao and Grauman (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, and lip movements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Gao and Grauman (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Pan <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Neuroscientific research has revealed that human perception of speech is inherently multi-modal, with lip movements being observed to enhance auditory perception during conversations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Stenzel <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Visual cues have proven to be robust auxiliary references for speaker extraction algorithms at the frame level, yielding remarkable outcomes in separating target speakers, particularly in the presence of highly overlapping speech <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ephrat <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Ochiai <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. However, the utilization of static facial images has demonstrated limited improvement in the performance of target speech extraction (TSE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gao and Grauman (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and may raise privacy concerns. Hence, this paper focuses on leveraging lip movements as the primary cue to guide TSE.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In previous studies on audio-visual target speech extraction (AV-TSE), it has been observed that visual information is often underutilized, resulting in performance comparable to ignoring visual cues. This situation arises due to the audio-focused nature of AV-TSE, where the richness of visual feature information is less substantial compared to audio feature information. Consequently, the importance of visual cues has been insufficiently considered, creating an imbalance between audio and visual modalities. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the concept of the speech chain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Denes and Pinson (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite> in speech science and propose the audio-visual speech separation chain (AVSepChain). The speech chain depicts the flow of information between speakers and perceivers in speech communication, encompassing two stages: speech production and speech perception <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Deller Jr (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite>. The information flow within the speech chain includes auditory feedback from the speaker’s mouth to the ears, the perceiver receiving acoustic information from the speaker, and the perceiver receiving visual information regarding the speaker’s lip movements, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Separate in the Speech Chain: Cross-Modal Conditional Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In our approach, we employ a two-stage method to replicate the inverse process of the two stages of the speech chain. In the first stage, we utilize the audio-visual target speech extraction network to simulate speech perception. This network extracts the target speaker’s speech from the mixed audio, leveraging the target speaker’s lip movements as a guiding condition. In the second stage, we employ the lip-to-speech synthesis network to simulate speech production. This network generates speech based on lip movements, utilizing the speech extracted in the first stage as a condition. Unlike previous AV-TSE approaches that solely relied on the video modality for conditional guidance, our approach alleviates the modality imbalance issue by incorporating both audio and video modalities as mutual conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To ensure the consistency between the speech content conveyed through the voice and lip movements of the target speaker, as depicted in the two channels of speech perception shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Separate in the Speech Chain: Cross-Modal Conditional Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we propose a contrastive semantic matching loss. Specifically, we employ audio and audio-visual self-supervised pre-trained models to extract frame-level quantized representations of speech content and lip movement content separately. These representations serve as pseudo-phonemes and pseudo-visemes, respectively, enabling us to align cross-modal semantics. A viseme represents a basic unit of visual speech, corresponding to a group of phonemes present in acoustic speech <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Massaro and Simpson (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>); Bear and Harvey (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. By capitalizing on the consistency between pseudo-visemes and pseudo-phonemes, we establish that the generated speech of the target speaker possesses the same semantic information as its lip movements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In general, this paper presents three main contributions. (i) We introduce the concept of speech chain into AV-TSE, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored previously. By leveraging the audio and video modalities as conditional information for each other, we simulate the speech perception and production processes in the speech chain, thereby alleviating the modality imbalance issue in AV-TSE. (ii) We propose a contrastive semantic matching loss to regulate the generation of more precise audio signals in the lip-to-speech synthesis network. This loss conducts contrastive matching training on the content information of the audio and video modalities, which is extracted using pre-trained models. (iii) We perform comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our approach. The results demonstrate that our proposed AVSepChain significantly enhances the state-of-the-art performance of AV-TSE.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The tongue and lips assume a crucial role in controlling the shape of the vocal tract and modifying its resonance characteristics to convey distinct phonemes. Perceivers can infer a speaker’s speech content by observing their lip movements, providing opportunities for integrating video into speech synthesis. Lip-to-speech synthesis (LTS) aims to convert visual information derived from the analysis of lip movements into corresponding speech signals. Similar to text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Mu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, most LTS methods follow a two-stage procedure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Prajwal <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Kim <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); de Mira <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>); Kim <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, involving the generation of mel-spectrograms followed by their transformation into audio signals using vocoders. In this paper, we propose predicting the residual signal of the preliminary separated speech to alleviate the difficulty of the LTS task. Moreover, LTS inherently poses an underdetermined problem, as a single lip movement video can correspond to multiple speech possibilities. To impose constraints, previous research commonly introduced reference speech from the same speaker and employed a speaker encoder to obtain speaker embeddings as guiding information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">de Mira <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>); Choi <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023b</a>); Kim <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. However, in this study, we utilize the target speaker’s speech extracted during the speech perception stage as the registration, eliminating the need for additional speaker reference speech. Furthermore, we implicitly constrain the synthesis process by predicting the residual signal.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When dealing with audio-visual data, which involves multiple modalities, a common challenge is modality imbalance. Modality imbalance occurs when one modality dominates over others in a specific task or scenario. To alleviate this issue, a common approach is to adjust the training strategy of the model to balance the learning process for each modality. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">Fan <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span></a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fan <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> introduced modality-specific loss functions and regularization terms to enhance the learning of non-dominant modalities. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">Fu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span></a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span></a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> balanced the learning process of different modalities by dynamically adjusting gradients and learning rates, enabling the model to allocate more attention to non-dominant modalities. Another approach, as proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">Du <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span></a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Du <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, involves leveraging pre-trained single-modal models to tackle the modality imbalance problem. They extracted features from the single-modal model and distilled them into the multi-modal model, thereby improving the learning of non-dominant modalities. In this study, we alleviate the issue of modality imbalance by shifting the dominant role between two modalities at different stages.</p>

AV-HuBERT is a self-supervised model designed for audio-visual learning, which predicts clustering assignments in masked regions based on speech features and lip movement sequences.

AV-Sepformer extends Sepformer by incorporating the cross-attention mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Vaswani <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> to integrate both audio and visual modalities. In this study, similar to AV-Sepformer, we employ cross-modal attention to fuse audio and video features. In this case, considering that the visual information can be regarded as cues for separating the target speech, we adopt an approach where the audio modality is treated as the dominant modality while the visual modality acts as the conditional modality.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">During the speech production stage, it is crucial to handle the intrinsic one-to-many relationship between visemes and phonemes, as well as accommodate speech-related variations such as voice, accents, and prosody. To tackle these challenges, we leverage the target speech that was extracted in the previous stage as a registration to facilitate the synthesis of speech from lip movements. In contrast to the previous stage, we assign vision as the dominant modality and audio as the conditional modality in this stage, aiming to mitigate modality imbalance issues.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2" class="ltx_p">During the speech production stage, our approach involves predicting the residual signal rather than the complete speech waveform. This strategy aims to provide a preliminary candidate for the AV-Synthesizer, thus alleviating the challenge of modeling the entire speech signal. By focusing on the residuals, the AV-Synthesizer can effectively capture the remaining information necessary for synthesis and refine the preliminary results. This strategy also incorporates an implicit constraint into the synthesis process. To ensure that the generated speech accurately corresponds to lip movements, we also employ the SI-SNR between <math id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s_{fin}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">s</mi><mrow id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">f</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">i</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1a" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.4" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.4.cmml">n</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑠</ci><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3"><times id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑓</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝑖</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.4">𝑛</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.m1.1c">s_{fin}</annotation></semantics></math> and the true signal as the loss function <math id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{L}_{\text{syn}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">ℒ</mi><mtext id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.3a.cmml">syn</mtext></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.2">ℒ</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.3a.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.3"><mtext mathsize="70%" id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1.1.3">syn</mtext></ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p4.2.m2.1c">\mathcal{L}_{\text{syn}}</annotation></semantics></math> during the speech production stage.</p>

Both LRS2-2Mix and VoxCeleb2-2Mix consist of mixtures of two speakers. We randomly selected two distinct speakers and mixed their speech with a signal-to-noise ratio ranging from -5 dB to 5 dB. These datasets contain multilingual speech corrupted by noise. The speaker identities in the training and test sets do not overlap. Each speech segment has a duration of 2 seconds and a sampling rate of 16 kHz. The video frames are synchronized with the speech at a frame rate of 25 FPS. In our experiments, we cropped the lip region and resized the cropped frames to <math id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="88\times 88" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">88</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">88</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">88</cn><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">88</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">88\times 88</annotation></semantics></math> pixels, resulting in a height and width of <math id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="H=W=88" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">H</mi><mo id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">=</mo><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.4" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.cmml">W</mi><mo id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.5" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.5.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.6" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.cmml">88</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1"><and id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1a.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1"></and><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1b.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"></eq><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝐻</ci><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.4">𝑊</ci></apply><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1c.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.5"></eq><share href="#S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.cmml" id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1d.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1"></share><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.6">88</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1c">H=W=88</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

In this experiment, we employed these models to extract visual embeddings, which were then utilized as inputs for the AV-Separator and AV-Synthesizer, as well as for calculating the contrastive semantic matching loss. The experimental results, presented in Table <a href="#S3.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ AV-Synthesizer. ‣ 3.3 Speech Production ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Separate in the Speech Chain: Cross-Modal Conditional Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, consistently reveal the superior performance of AV-HuBERT over other models, both as input to the network and for computing the loss. Notably, AV-HuBERT significantly outperforms other pre-trained lip-reading models as a pseudo-viseme extractor in estimating the semantic matching loss. This superior performance can be attributed to the integration of visual (lip movement) and auditory (audio signals) information in AV-HuBERT, which enables the model to grasp the relationship between lip movement and speech, thereby enhancing lip-reading accuracy. Moreover, AV-HuBERT shares a similar self-supervised learning framework with HuBERT, involving feature clustering and masked prediction. Consequently, utilizing AV-HuBERT as a pseudo-viseme extractor leads to semantic feature representations that better align with those of HuBERT, resulting in improved effectiveness of the contrastive semantic matching loss.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.SSS0.Px5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To validate the effectiveness of cross-modal modulation using cross-modal attention, we compared various modulation strategies, including concatenation and summation. The results are presented in Table <a href="#S3.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ AV-Synthesizer. ‣ 3.3 Speech Production ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Separate in the Speech Chain: Cross-Modal Conditional Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. The findings demonstrate a significant superiority of the employed cross-modal attention method compared to other approaches. This superiority stems from the adaptive learning capability of cross-modal attention, which enables the determination of weights for each modality rather than simply feature combination or addition. Consequently, the model can accurately control the contribution of each modality by dynamically adjusting the dominant and conditional status of different modalities according to the specific task requirements, achieved by modifying the modalities of the query, key, and value. Furthermore, the model can selectively focus on the most pertinent and valuable information within each modality based on the specific task, thereby reducing the impact of redundant information. This refinement enhances the robustness and generalization ability of our model.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.SSS0.Px6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In AVSepChain, we alleviate the issue of modality imbalance by dynamically switching between dominant and conditional modalities. This is accomplished by modifying the queries, keys, and values of the cross-modal attention in various tasks. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted comparative experiments by altering the order of queries, keys, and values. The results of these experiments are presented in Table <a href="#S3.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ AV-Synthesizer. ‣ 3.3 Speech Production ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Separate in the Speech Chain: Cross-Modal Conditional Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. As the keys and values in the cross-modal attention should originate from the same feature, there are four potential settings. The outcomes demonstrate that our configuration consistently achieves the most favorable performance. Additionally, the table reveals that using either audio or visual modalities as the dominant modality for both the speech perception and speech production stages results in a significant modality imbalance problem, potentially leading to failure in the other conditional modality. When the positions of the audio and visual modalities are swapped, the negative impact increases considerably, suggesting that the dominant modality should be assigned as the keys and values, while the conditional modality should serve as the query.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From the perspective of the speech chain, this paper proposes AVSepChain, which simulates the process of speech perception and speech production in the speech chain. Its objective is to alleviate the modality imbalance problem in AV-TSE by considering audio and visual modalities as conditional modalities for each other. This is achieved by assigning different modalities as queries, keys, and values for cross-modal attention. Furthermore, to ensure that the synthesized speech preserves the same semantic information as the lip movement video during the speech production process, a contrastive semantic matching loss is proposed. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach, indicating that our method defines state-of-the-art performance on the AV-TSE task by mitigating modality imbalance.</p>
