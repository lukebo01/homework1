<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Exploring proper way to conduct multi-speech feature fusion for cross-corpus speech emotion recognition is crucial as different speech features could provide complementary cues reflecting human emotion status. While most previous approaches only extract a single speech feature for emotion recognition, existing fusion methods such as concatenation, parallel connection, and splicing ignore heterogeneous patterns in the interaction between features and features, resulting in performance of existing systems. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fusion method to explicitly model the relationships between every pair of speech features. Specifically, we propose a multi-dimensional edge features learning strategy called Graph-based multi-Feature fusion method for speech emotion recognition. It represents each speech feature as a node and learns multi-dimensional edge features to explicitly describe the relationship between each feature-feature pair in the context of emotion recognition. This way, the learned multi-dimensional edge features encode speech feature-level information from both the vertex and edge dimensions. Our Approach consists of three modules: an Audio Feature Generation(AFG)module, an Audio-Feature Multi-dimensional Edge Feature(AMEF) module and a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) module. The proposed methodology yielded satisfactory outcomes on the SEWA dataset. Furthermore, the method demonstrated enhanced performance compared to the baseline in the AVEC 2019 Workshop and Challenge. We used data from two cultures as our training and validation sets: two cultures containing German and Hungarian on the SEWA dataset, the CCC scores for German are improved by 17.28% for arousal and 7.93% for liking, and for Hungarian, the CCC scores are improved by 11.15% for arousal and 131.11% for valence. The outcomes of our methodology demonstrate a 13% improvement over alternative fusion techniques, including those employing one dimensional edge-based feature fusion approach.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Speech is an easily accessible medium for humans to communicate their intentions and messages, which can be conveyed via ubiquitous devices such as microphones and phone. Consequently, many previous studies devoted to recognizing human emotions from their speeches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Recent development in speech emotion recognition has greatly transformed consumer shopping, information gathering, and communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Practice feedback has been well applied commercially to the fields of human-computer interaction, healthcare, and marketing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A key challenge in speech emotion recognition is to learn discriminative emotional representations from raw speech signals. Early studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> used low-level hand-crafted features to complete speech emotion recognition tasks, including Low level descriptors(LLDS) and High level statistics functions (HSFs, e.g. mean and maximum values of LLDs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Based on LLDs, researchers applied audio word bag (BoAW) to extract features in an unsupervised manner, and obtained more statistical information by aggregating multiple frame-level descriptive words from audio segments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. However, the above-mentioned hand-crafted features may fail to learn task-specific (e.g., emotion-related) features from the given audio signals. As a result, with the emergence of deep learning model, more and more speech emotion recognition methods have been built on Deep Neural Network (DNNs), which can be optimized based on the target and thus can extract task-specific features from audios to make better predictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Deep learning methods can extract hierarchical and discriminative feature representations through supervised learning, and the application of models such as CNN and LSTM has also been shown to further improve accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Recently, other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as self-attention mechanisms, have also been proposed for SER tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In previous studies, researchers frequently predict emotions based on a single speech feature described above <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. In the context of SER tasks, low-level hand-crafted features have been employed in small-sample data sets due to their transparent computational principles and straightforward structure. In contrast, deep learning methods are more suited to feature extraction tasks in massive data sets, as they are capable of automatically learning optimal feature representations and combining low-level features to form novel features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
For speech emotion recognition, the use of a single type of feature in some cases leads to low recognition accuracy. First, when dealing with speech data from speakers with different backgrounds, due to the influence of contextual factors such as gender information, language, culture, etc., these problems lead to a single audio feature that cannot cover all the emotional information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>; second, when dealing with speech data with a large amplitude of emotional change, due to the influence of the speaker’s emotion, the existence of changes in the speed of speech, as well as the difference in the energy between the various spectra, a single feature can only express speech’s emotional information from one side to express the emotional information of speech, so a single type of feature has a performance bottleneck in speech emotion recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the limitations of speech recognition based on a single speech feature, combining different speech features has proven to be an effective solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Specifically, the most common solution is to directly concatenate multiple different speech features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. For example, Zhou et al. combine emotion feature maps extracted from different spectral diagrams, thereby enhancing the accuracy of speech recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Alternatively, some studies conduct decision-level fusion, which first make an emotion prediction from each feature and then average all predictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. However, both strategies fail to comprehensively model the inter-relation between different speech features, which may lead to not only the final combined feature contain redundant information but also ignore crucial relationship cues for the emotion recognition. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted more attentions from researchers for speech emotion analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. However, the node features used in this study are all deep learning features from LSTM outputs, and as mentioned earlier, a single feature type can provide very limited useful information. Therefore, we propose the hypothesis that using different types of speech features as nodes, more useful information can be learned from neighboring nodes using an effective aggregation method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fusion strategy that leverages the merits of both deep-learned and hand-crafted audio features for speech emotion recognition. Inspired by GRATIS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, we propose a novel method that learns a multi-dimensional edge feature to explicitly describe the relationship between each pair of to address the challenge of feature integration in cross-corpus speech emotion recognition. Compared to methods such as GIN, it has higher coupling with non-graphical heterogeneous data such as deep learning and hand-crafted audio features and can easily be combined with various deep learning backbone and GNN to predict different downstream tasks, facilitating subsequent speech emotion classification. Our approach consists of three modules: an Audio Feature Generation (AFG) module, an Audio-Feature Multi-dimensional Edge Feature (AMEF) module and a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) module. Initially, it draws upon two conventional features, eGeMAPs and MFCCs, as well as two bag-of-words models, BoAW-e and BoAW-m, and the deep learning feature, Deep Spectrum. AFG module extracts five feature vectors representing these five speech features within an LSTM framework. In a subsequent phase, the AMEF module was used to construct a graph representation based on multidimensional edges, which is ultimately integrated into a combined feature. Finally, the combined feature is fed back into the model as an input. The SER module completes the emotion recognition of speech vectors through regression methods, resulting in the outcome.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The primary task of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is to extract and identify the emotional information contained in speech. Over the past several decades, the study of identifying human emotional states from speech through computer technology has been a popular field of research. The SER system’s recognition process of speech emotions is divided into two steps. Firstly, speech features need to be extracted. These features carry contextual information and are important sources of information for computers to recognize emotions. In early research, the common features used in speech emotion recognition by academia included prosody features, spectral features, and timbre features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The hand-crafted features include statistical functions such as mean values and extrema, as well as features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Linear Predictive Coding (LPC), and Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. On the basis of LLDs, researchers have used the Audio Word Bag (BoAW) to extract features in an unsupervised manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, many studies have begun to use deep learning methods to extract Deep Spectrum representations from audio segments. Deep Spectrum representations are mainly due to the advantages of transfer learning, as they are formed by passing spectral maps through pre-trained image classification CNNs such as AlexNet or VGG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Deep Spectrum features are also typical Deep Spectrum features, and have been proven effective for various general audio recognition tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. For example, the DeepSpectrumLite transfer learning framework is used for pre-training image convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for speech recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Moreover, humans may have more than one tone when speaking, and the diversity of tones represents changes in emotion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Under such circumstances, the boundaries of emotional recognition become even more complex due to human factors. On the other hand, the perception of speech in a language depends on factors such as the speaker’s cultural background, language, gender, and even the speaker’s age, which makes speech emotion recognition more complex <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Based on the above description, the second step of speech emotion recognition is to classify the emotional content of the speech file through machine learning and other classification algorithms. In most cases, classifiers are divided into two main categories: traditional classifiers and deep learning classifiers. Traditional classifiers include SVM, HMM, GMM, KNN, decision trees, LDA, and maximum likelihood methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. In contrast, there has been an increasing number of studies in recent years using deep learning classifiers such as CNN, DNN, RNN, DBN, LSTM, and DBM for speech emotion recognition. Notably, the emotional content in speech changes over time, so it is appropriate to use techniques that are effective for modeling time, such as stochastic HMMs or neural networks with recursive units, such as LSTM or GRU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite notable progress in emotion recognition, cross-corpus speech emotion recognition remains a significant challenge due to cultural and linguistic disparities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. In the CES sub-project of the AVEC 2019 Workshop and Challenge, Fabien and colleagues utilized a 2-layer LSTM-RNN (64/32 units) as the time-dependent regressor for each representation of audio signals and employed SVMs for late-stage fusion of predictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. Compared to the performance reported in the previous AVEC CES, arousal and valence scores for German improved by 7.25% and 8.25%, respectively, while those for Hungarian improved by 17.3% and 13.3%, respectively. However, the study still faces an issue: individual features such as the MFCCs, eGeMAPs, and deep learning DEEP SPECTRUM cannot achieve optimal results across multiple emotion categories due to varying information content within each feature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. This is particularly true since these features describe emotional information from different perspectives. Therefore, there is a need to find a method for deep fusion of features to generate new ones, aiming for better results across multiple emotion categories.</p>

In recent years, there have been studies using multi-dimensional edge features to describe specific relationships between vertices, such as using heuristic edge features to represent relationships <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>. However, these hand-crafted features still cannot capture specific task relationship information between vertices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>. This requires a graph representation learning framework to automatically generate task-specific topology and multi-dimensional edge features for different input modalities. Some studies have utilized multiple sub-graphs to learn rich node representations in graph-based networks, proposing two types of edge features and effectively combining them with GAT and GCN models for relationship extraction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>. Prior to this, multi-dimensional edge features have been widely used in areas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>, <a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>, <a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>, <a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>]</cite>. Song et al. proposed a general graph representation learning framework (called GRATIS) that can generate strong graph representations with specific task topologies and multi-dimensional edge features for arbitrary inputs. Research results show that GRATIS not only greatly enhances pre-defined graphs but also learns strong graph representations of non-graph data, resulting in significant performance improvements across all tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. We leverage the GRATIS graph representation learning framework as an auxiliary task, fully utilizing information from various speech feature datasets.</p>

First, our Audio Feature Generation (AFG) module extracts features from the given audio signal, including five hand-crafted features, namely eGeMAPs and MFCCs, two bag-of-words model features, BoAW-e, and BoAW-m, as well as deep learning features, Deep Spectrum. These five features encompass different speech emotional information. The feature extraction is accomplished through two layers of LSTM. Secondly, Due to the varying dimensions of diverse types of speech features, a 2-layer LSTM-RNN (64/32 units) can be employed to achieve a uniform feature vector dimensionality. Thirdly, the GRATIS framework generate graph representations with task-specific topology and multidimensional edge features, since speech features are non-graph data, the input speech features will be represented by a set of vectors and the GRATIS framework connects them into a matrix, by training to obtain the optimal topology. This vector, through edge feature information, contains the association between features, and through point feature information, represents the differences between features. Finally, the vector is fed back into the model as an input, and the end-to-end output is obtained through a fully connected layer.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Before feature fusion, we need to preprocess different types of features, The method comprises two stages. The first stage involves unifying the vector dimensions of each type of speech feature, represented as a graph comprising speech features with the same vector dimensions. This reduces the computational complexity of the subsequent speech emotion recognition model. Second, to consider the temporal sequence when processing the feature vectors, due to the time-series nature of the speech data, the LSTM is more time-sensitive than the ordinary RNN, and it can learn the patterns and features in the time-series data. Therefore, we choose a 2-layer LSTM-RNN to standardize the dimension of speech feature vectors. The 2-layer LSTM layers with different units can better capture the key information between sequential data.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.2" class="ltx_p">The vertex features are initially fed to a backbone, which may be any suitable machine learning model. In the case of graph data, this may be a GNN, whereas in the case of non-graph data, this may be a Transformer. In this study, we have chosen to use a BiGRU model as the backbone. The composition of the backbone is due to the fact that the BiGRU model introduces a bi-directional structure on top of the GRU model, which better captures the bi-directional dependencies of sequential data, such as speech features. In our implementation, we use GRU as the backbone, to directly extract the global contextual representation<math id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{\/Y}\in{\mathbb{R}}^{A\times K\times N}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">𝐘</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">∈</mo><msup id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">ℝ</mi><mrow id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">A</mi><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml">×</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3.cmml">K</mi><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1a" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml">×</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.4" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.4.cmml">N</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1"><in id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"></in><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐘</ci><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2">ℝ</ci><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><times id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2">𝐴</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3">𝐾</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.4">𝑁</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1c">\mathbf{\/Y}\in{\mathbb{R}}^{A\times K\times N}</annotation></semantics></math> from the input data, where A denotes the number of vertices.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS4.p3.12" class="ltx_p">In order to better integrate the multidimensional edge feature learning method for multiple speech features, The graph was constructed using the GCN model after the multidimensional edge features were obtained. These features were then combined with the previously obtained task-specific topology and vertex features. The task-specific vertex features were used to create the task-specific topology, which was then used as input.The task-specific topology is unified with the multidimensional edge feature through multiplication. Prior to this, the task-specific topology is reshaped once, with the reshaped dimension matching that of the multidimensional edge features.</p>

This is because when calculating the update for each node, it is necessary to take into account how many edges point to that node. Compared to traditional feature fusion methods, our method first fuse node features by applying convolution operation on the graph structure, through which not only the features of the node itself are fused, but also the features of the neighbouring nodes are taken into account, and then the edge information is preserved by the method of multidimensional edge features.

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Table 2 shows the overall performance compared to the baseline. From the results, we observe that the proposed model consistently outperforms all the baselines, indicating the effectiveness of the fusion method in speech feature fusion. More precisely, the method proposed in this paper improves upon the baseline in the AVEC 2019 Workshop and Challenge: on the SEWA dataset, the CCC scores for German are improved by 17.28% for arousal and 7.93% for liking, and for Hungarian, the CCC scores are improved by 11.15% for arousal and 131.11% for valence. It is noteworthy that the efficacy of our method is less pronounced in the ’DE+HU’ dataset, with a mere 2.5% improvement observed in Arousal and a more pronounced decline in Valence compared to the previous baseline. This may be attributed to the existence of significant linguistic differences between languages, which are not adequately captured by the multidimensional edge features. Consequently, the resulting feature representation may be less accurate. This indicates that by integrating speech features through GRU and multi-dimensional edge feature learning, potential feature information can be extracted, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To more accurately assess the extent to which the different modules influence the final result, three distinct data sources were employed for the purpose of speech emotion recognition. The first approach utilises solely the task-specific vertex features derived from the TTF part for linear layer processing, thereby completing the prediction. The second approach employs the original vertex features that have not undergone processing by the TTF module, in conjunction with the initial topology, to complete the AMEF module. Additionally, the new feature vectors derived from the aforementioned training are subjected to linear layer processing, thereby completing the prediction. The training data are subjected to linear layer processing and complete the prediction. The third method is based on the aforementioned complete method and uses the task-specific topology and vertex features as inputs. The new feature vectors obtained after training through the AMEF module are processed in linear layers and complete the prediction.</p>

The fusion method further improves the fusion of all speech features, most notably by accomplishing dimensionality unification, and the new features do not increase the computational complexity of the emotion recognition model as deep spectral features do. To compare data more intuitively, this study averaged the three emotion classification results (Arousal, Valence, and Liking) of the ”DE+HU” cross-cultural dataset.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p10.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Figure 3, based on the average value, it can be found that our fusion method is 13% better than the results GNN+OD-edge methods. This also reflects that these simple series and parallel methods result in a decrease in model accuracy due to the neglect of edge features. The GNN+ST method and GNN+OD-edge method has considered the importance of edge features, so their results are better than the previously mentioned Feature fusion-FC method that only considers point features. However, our multi-dimensional edge feature fusion results are still better than these single-dimensional edge feature fusion methods, this could be because multi-dimensional edge features can express key information between different speech features, highlighting the role of vertex and edge relationship information in speech emotion recognition.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p11.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS5.p11.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">t-SNE results:</span> As shown in Figure 4, to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we utilize t-SNE to illustrate the impact of the aforementioned approach in the context of an ablation experiment. To this end, we employ a dataset comprising 40,032 frames of speech belonging to the ”DE+HU” group. Each data point is represented by a 10-dimensional output vector, which is subsequently transformed into two dimensions through the use of a dimensionality reduction tool. This transformation allows us to represent the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the points in the graph, respectively. The color of the point is represented by the label value of the point’s sentiment category (arousal, validity, and liking). The larger the value, the redder the color, and the smaller the value, the bluer the color. As can be seen from the figure, our method has better clustering results, as the darker points (indicating strong emotions) have higher overlapping coordinates in the plot. In contrast, for methods with suboptimal experimental results, such as the “Feature fusion-AVE” group, the distribution of points with strong emotions is more dispersed in the t-SNE plots of arousal and validity.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p12.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, we found that the TTF feature and the AMEF feature achieved good results in the results, while the TTF feature was superior to the AMEF feature. In order to test our research hypothesis that TTF and AMEF can better capture the best relational cues between different types of speech features, we conducted an experiment where TTF features and AMEF features were fused with two, three, and four sets of speech features, respectively.In this fusion, we discarded the speech features that yielded the worst results: three (MFCC, BoWA-M, DS), two (BoWA-M, DS), and one (BoWA-M).By examining the CCC scores of the prediction outcomes, we observed that the scores decreased as the number of retained feature types diminished.This suggests that even when the prediction performance of a single type of speech feature is below average, our method can still identify relational clues among different types of speech features that are beneficial for enhancing prediction performance.
Consequently, our approach can further improve prediction performance.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a novel approach to speech feature fusion that employs graphical representation learning and graphical neural networks to model speech features derived from disparate datasets.The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of various speech features on speech emotion recognition in the SEWA dataset. Initially, features are extracted from each frame of the input audio in order to obtain five features that capture different aspects of speech emotion information. Subsequently, these features are processed through a two-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract vectors. This paper presents an innovative approach to speech feature fusion that uses the multidimensional edge feature approach. This approach combines speech feature vectors into a unified representation that captures the interactions between features through edge information and the uniqueness of features through point information. Furthermore, ablation studies were conducted using different feature merging and fusion methods. The results of the experiments conducted on the SEWA dataset demonstrate the accuracy of the method. Furthermore, two sets of experiments, t-SNE and different combinations, were performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The main limitations of this study are: (1) the dataset utilised is limited to the SEWA dataset; and (2) the data features of other modalities, such as video, have not been explored. In the future, we intend to incorporate a wider range of speech features and cross-corpus datasets to further optimise our method.</p>
