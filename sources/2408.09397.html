<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id6.id1.1" class="ltx_text">In this paper, we propose a novel framework, <span id="id6.id1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Combo</span>, for harmonious co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaption.
In particular, we identify that one fundamental challenge as the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) nature of the generative model of interest.
More concretely, on the input end, the model typically consumes both speech signals and character guidance (<em id="id6.id1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g., </em>identity and emotion), which hinders further adaptation to varying guidance; on the output end, holistic human motions mainly consist of facial expressions and body movements, which are inherently correlated but non-trivial to coordinate in current data-driven generation process.
In response to the above challenge, we propose tailored designs to both ends.
For the former, we propose to pre-train on data regarding a fixed identity with neutral emotion, and defer the incorporation of customizable conditions (identity and emotion) to fine-tuning stage, which is boosted by our novel <span id="id6.id1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>-Adapter for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
For the latter, we propose a simple yet effective transformer design, DU-Trans, which first divides into two branches to learn individual features of face expression and body movements, and then unites those to learn a joint bi-directional distribution and directly predicts combined coefficients.
Evaluated on BEAT2 and SHOW datasets, <span id="id6.id1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Combo</span> is highly effective in generating high-quality motions but also efficient in transferring identity and emotion.

Thus they require training or finetuning the entire network for different conditions. In contrast, we pre-train a model in a relatively clear setting, and adapt various conditions in the fine-tuning stage. Our design allows flexible and efficient adaptation (<em id="S1.F1.9.2.3.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">1 Hour PEFT</em>) for identity customization and emotion transfer, as depicted in part (c). Notably, we only utilize the embeddings from emotional text prompts encoded by CLIP as guidance during training. At inference, other modalities such as motion clips, audios, and images can all serve as emotional conditions, thereby supporting flexible multi-modal editing, as depicted in part (c).</span></span></figcaption>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study the problem of co-speech holistic 3D human motions generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, namely, given speech signal and character conditions (<em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g., </em>identity, emotion), generating facial expressions and body movements including hand gestures and body motions.
This generation task is crucial in crafting digital avatars as it significantly enhances the interaction informativeness and vividness of the latter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, therefore attracting increasing interest from generative AI research.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One fundamental challenge of this task stems from its multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nature:
1) the input end gathers not only various factors including speech contents, rhythms, and semantics, but also character conditions like identities and emotions;
2) the output end delivers both facial and body motions, which are inherently related but non-trivial to align.
For humans, such a perplexing system is well governed by a nervous system, yielding harmonious, adaptive (<em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g., </em>regarding emotion changes) holistic motions in real life.
On the other hand, generative models typically take a data-driven approach to learning from human videos.
While being straightforward, it is highly non-trivial to learn the inherent relationships within the MIMO system purely from data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In light of the above,
we examine the holistic human motion generation task from a principled perspective and advocate two novel designs tailored for improving data-driven generative model.
Our key insight is to alleviate modeling complexity in both input and output end, leading to a <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">harmonious but also adaptive</em> generative network.
For the input end, instead of training an encoder that consumes all at once, we pre-train a model in a relatively clear setting, and defer the injection of important conditions to the fine-tuning stage;
For the output end, we propose a divide-and-unite strategy to address the trade-off between learning accurate facial and body movements and guaranteeing coherence.
In the following, we motivate and explain the above designs in more detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">multiple input end</span>, our generative model is expected to take speeches as generation guidance, which contain factors such as contents, rhythms, semantics, and so on.
It is worth noting that the same speech guidance can lead to different motion sequences with respect to varying conditions (<em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g., </em>identity and emotion), complicating the learning process.
The significant contributions to high-quality dataset construction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, containing rich annotations as well as great variability in identity and emotions, offer good opportunities for learning a comprehensive model.
However, we argue that learning a comprehensive model lacks flexibility in further adaptation.
In fact, generative models have been widely desired to be controllable and customizable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Regarding holistic human motion generation, one would naturally expect a flexible, adaptive digital avatar with respect to changes in both short-term emotional states (emotion) and long-term personality (identity).
Unfortunately, recent efforts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> require an extensive training or full-parameter fine-tuning process to accommodate to the emotional data or newly introduced identities, a limitation that is particularly exacerbated in VQ-VAE-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the above observations, we take a pre-train-and-fine-tune approach.
During pre-training, we train a model with data from a fixed identity in neutral emotion.
The injection of specific conditions, such as alternative identities and/or emotions, is deferred to the fine-tuning stage.
Our key design in this part is a novel plug-and-play adapter for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>-Adapter, which is tailored to our pipeline and allows for effective and efficient fine-tuning on emotion transfer and personalized generation.
Our treatment on input end admits several advantages: 1) It alleviates the learning burden during pre-train stage, therefore improving the performance; 2) Built upon the advanced pre-training, the fine-tuning phase can achieve superior performance with minimal computational cost; 3) As a by-product, it further enables versatile editing during inference benefiting from flexible <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span> cues, which is a capability that previous approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> could not attain. For instance, we can employ multi-modal conditions within the CLIP domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> to indicate the short-term emotion, which supports flexible and generalizable zero-shot editing.
We can also define identity codes as several interpretable statistics of SMPLX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to depict long-term personality.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">multiple output end</span>, holistic human motion involves both facial expressions and body movements with different patterns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, presents a dual challenge: direct holistic modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is difficult to maintain uniqueness, while separate modeling struggles to generate harmonious full-body natural movements.
For the former, ProbTalk <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> directly models the holistic motions for coordination but fails to learn accurate individual distribution.
For the latter, TalkSHOW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> completely ignores the interconnection and results in disjointed coordination among different motion components.
Subsequent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> identify this discrepancy and explicitly utilize a unidirectional flow between face and body to enhance the correlation.
However, the current arts are inadequate to achieve holistic harmony yet individual distinctive, leaving sufficient room for improvement, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(a).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, we propose a simple yet effective transformer design, <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DU</span>-Trans, which first <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">D</span>ivides into two branches to learn individual features of face expression and body movements, and then <span id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">U</span>nites those to learn a joint bi-directional distribution and directly predicts combined coefficients by a single output head.
Our treatment on the output end enjoys three-fold benefits:
1) By imposing supervision on the individual branches, it respects the distinctiveness between the two and ensures high-quality feature learning;
2) The learned features enable bi-directional communication between branches in the latent space, fully exploiting the modeling capacity and facilitating the cost of association in the explicit space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>;
3) The final unification allows for a single-head generation, further enhancing the overall harmony on top of jointly learned features from each branch.
Last but not least, combined with our design on the input end, DU-Trans also enables more harmonious customizable adaption.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.2" class="ltx_p">To conclude, we have established <span id="S1.p8.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Combo</span>, a novel framework for <span id="S1.p8.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">co</span>-speech holistic 3D human <span id="S1.p8.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">m</span>otion generation and efficient customiza<span id="S1.p8.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">b</span>le adaption, both in harm<span id="S1.p8.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">o</span>ny.
Interestingly, our framework echoes its aberration – like a jazz band, it emphasizes harmony during training and inference (practice and play).
Moreover, a well-trained jazz band can promptly incorporate with a new leader and/or play a new song with proper rehearsal.
Similarly, <span id="S1.p8.2.6" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter">Combo</span> can be adapted to new identities (leader) and/or emotions (a genre of songs) with efficient fine-tuning (rehearsing) as well.
To validate the above, we comprehensively perform both quantitative and qualitative evaluations in BEAT2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and SHOW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> datasets.

For speech-driven facial movement generation, it is often referred to as talking face generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, whether in 2D or 3D, is a vibrant field that involves creating animated faces that can mimic human speech and expressions. Recent 3D facial animation leverage blendshapes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> or 3D meshes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> as the structure representation to control the lip shapes and capture speech nuances. Considering the complexity of mapping speech to facial expressions, probabilistic models such as VQ-VAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and diffusion models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> have been employed to predict the distribution of facial expressions derived from speech signals. Similarly, methods for speech-driven gesture generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> are also designed to estimate the mapping or probability distribution of body and hand motion with the help of various condition modalities, including acoustic features, linguistic characteristics, speaker identities, and emotions.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, Habibie <em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> first utilized a CNN-based framework to generate 3D facial meshes and 3D key points of the body and hands simultaneously. However, they overlook the coordination between body parts, and at the same time, deterministic models also lead to a lack of diversity. Thus, subsequent works all resort to a generative model to incorporate
diversity into motion generation. TalkSHOW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is built upon the VQ-VAE and designs a cross-conditioned mechanism between the body and hand motions to keep the synchronization of the gesture, but they treat facial expression estimation as an independent task. To address the coordination issue between expression and gestures, DiffSHEG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and EMAGE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> divide two encoders, one for expression and one for gesture, and establish a path for unidirectional information flow between each. ProbTalk <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> jointly models the holistic motion with the help of PQ-VAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> in a unified manner. Nevertheless, current methods fail to learn harmonious relationships between various body parts while maintaining the unique distribution of each. In our work, we explore the feasibility of this by a divide and unite mechanism for highly synchronized and coordinated full-body motions. Moreover, existing approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> typically require the definition of identities and emotions during training to guide the learning of specific characteristics. When the network encounters unseen identities and emotional styles, it may fail to generalize effectively, necessitating complete retraining or fine-tuning of the network with additional data to accommodate new conditions. In contrast, we introduce an efficient adaptation strategy that converts a pretrained model into various customized ones, enhancing the flexibility and applicability of our approach.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike conventional fine-tuning, which updates all parameters, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has shown impressive results across various tasks by updating only a subset of parameters. The three primary methods of PEFT are Adapter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, prefix-tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, and LoRA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. In the realm of NLP, the concept of adapters was first introduced by the Serial Adapter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> model. This model enhances each Transformer block by incorporating two additional adapter modules, one after the self-attention layer and the other after the feed-forward neural network (FFN) layer. Parallel Adapter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, on the other hand, restructures these sequential layers into a parallel side network that operates in tandem with each Transformer sublayer. Our <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>-Adapter is largely based on this concept. With the growing interest in diffusion models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, recent studies have applied PEFT to refine pre-trained diffusion models for specialized tasks. We introduce two key applications, including integrating additional input modalities and customizing content generation. Specifically, GLIGEN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> integrates new trainable gated Transformer layers without altering the original model’s weights, while ControlNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> fine-tunes a separate encoding layer copy from Stable Diffusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> while locks its pre-trained parameter weights. T2I-Adapter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> adds a lightweight model to synchronize external controls with the model’s internal processes. For customization, Textual Inversion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> identifies pseudo-words for concept representation, and IP-Adapter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> inserts an image-focused attention layer for feature enhancement. Notably, EAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> employs a pre-train-and-fine-tune approach similar to ours, but they extend a trainable encoder branch for fine-tuning directly, which is neither as efficient nor as effective as PEFT.
In this work, we integrate PEFT into the domain of holistic 3D human motion generation for flexible adaptation, which is the first attempt in this field.</p>

In this part, we follow the common practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> to decompose input speech signal into content, rhythm, and semantics.
As suggested by recent progress <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the local lip motion is strongly correlated with the input audio content, and the global facial expression is related to the audio rhythm.
While the body has a weaker correlation with the content, yet is intricately connected to audio semantics and rhythm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>.
Early approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> leverages MFCC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> to encode speech, which falls short of capturing rich speech information and struggles with disentangling each component.

Given the markedly different audio-related dynamics of facial expressions and gestures, it is essential to independently model these components for enhanced synchronization.
However, this approach alone risks neglecting the intrinsic connections between them and could cause disjointed coordination.
Previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> have recognized this issue, but they only introduce uni-flow and use multiple heads to predict individual coefficients still hindering overall coordination.
In contrast, we propose a divide-and-unite strategy that respects the distinct modeling needs of each component while implicitly accounting for their interrelationships and directly predicting a unified set of coefficients, thus possessing synchronization and coordination in a unified framework.
Specifically, we combine this strategy with a diffusion model.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Method ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(a), we first implement four key designs to learn the distinct dynamic characteristics of the face and body:</p>

Inspired by GestureDiffuCLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, we aim to align emotion cues to the CLIP domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and enable the use of various multi-modal prompts to indicate emotions. As a result, any accessible modality can serve as guidance, making the application more flexible. Additionally, it can support unknown emotion guidance, thanks to the rich semantics provided by CLIP. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.4 Conditional Editing based on X-Adapter ‣ 3 Method ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, our system allows users to describe the desired emotion by text, image, audio, and motion sequence. Specifically, for the text prompt, we can directly specify emotional conditions, <em id="S3.SS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S3.SS4.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span>, <span id="S3.SS4.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">The person is happy</span> or provide descriptive prompts for GPT to generate the corresponding emotional text prompts, <em id="S3.SS4.p2.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S3.SS4.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text"></span>, <span id="S3.SS4.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">How is the person feel when chatting with a close friend about a joke</span>, and then extract corresponding embeddings by CLIP encoder. Similarly, we align image prompts with the emotional text prompts by GPT. For example, <span id="S3.SS4.p2.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">How is the person feel [a picture of a happy face]</span> or <span id="S3.SS4.p2.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">How is the person feel if he/she speaks in [a picture of a beautiful garden]</span>. The above two are train-free. When querying, we instruct GPT to select the most fitting emotional category from the following options <span id="S3.SS4.p2.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sadness, contempt, neutral, fear, anger, happiness, disgust, surprise]</span>. For the last two, we employ a pretrained wav2vec2.0 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite> model, specialized in emotion recognition, to distill effective information from audio. In parallel, we adopt the framework of Motionclip <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite> to learn emotional features from motion sequences. These output cues are further mapped into the CLIP domain and constrained by computing cosine similarity with the CLIP embeddings of emotional text prompts. The above two are trained in BEAT2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> dataset. Consequently, our training uses only the embedding derived from text, yet inference allows various modalities as guidance.</p>

Identity is a crucial factor that affects long-term face and body movements. For example, in BEAT2 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, Scott is typically quite excited and speaks with broad facial and body gestures, while Nidal tends to be solemn, using only subtle hand movements when speaking.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first consider a clear training set, Neutral video clips of Scott from BEAT2.
We show that our method, trained from scratch (indicated by *), can achieve superior performance than the competing methods.
As shown in the top part of Tab. <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table I ‣ 4.1.4 Baselines ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, we begin by analyzing the synchronization of facial expressions, our method significantly outperforms the baselines in both MSE and LVD by a large margin, applicable to both specialized talking head generation methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and other holistic motion generation methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Then, we shift our focus to the quality of gestures, where previous co-speech methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> struggle to match our results.
Moreover, our method also outperforms TalkSHOW and EMAGE in terms of FGD and BC, with FGD being particularly notable, which indicates that the distribution of our results is the closest to the ground truth.
Note that our method’s DIV metric is slightly lower than that of TalkSHOW and EMAGE, which can be attributed to the fact that the comparative methods include some sudden and exaggerated meaningless movements, leading to a higher score.
Finally, we evaluate the motion produced by holistic methods from an comprehensive viewpoint.
Our approach shows remarkable advancements in FMD, indicating that it excels in generating synchronized and coordinated holistic body motions.
Overall, thanks to the divide and unite mechanism in DU-Trans, our method not only demonstrates superior performance in the metrics of individual components but also clearly leads to holistic metrics. Similar observations could also be concluded from the quantitative results on SHOW dataset, as shown in Tab. <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table II ‣ 4.2.1 Quantitative Results ‣ 4.2 Verification on DU-Trans ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.
Notably, the solid pre-training performance brought by this powerful basic architecture will benefit the subsequent fine-tuning stage.

In this section, we focus qualitative comparison with two recent SOTA methods, TalkSHOW and EMAGE, which can generate coherent motions. While the previous approaches like Habibie <em id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> suffer from varying degrees of jittering, thus we do not include them in this comparison.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the BEAT2 dataset, we focus on the Scott-Neutral part. As depicted in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.1.3 Metrics ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, TalkSHOW typically displays much slower and less varied motion than the other two, regardless of how the rhythm and semantic content of the audio change.
EMAGE, as an improved version of TalkSHOW, utilizes a more comprehensive VQ-VAE to encode the full body and also meticulously upgrades the motion generation network, resulting in superior performance compared to the former.
For example, EMAGE can respond to certain words that serve as emphasis, such as ”best” and ”leading”.
Yet, it still fails to generate expressive and lifelike gestures.
In contrast, our method is not only effective in conveying some concepts such as ”Buddhist temple” but also in interpreting semantic words like ”includes” and ”come to”, while being synchronized with rhythmic elements and emphasis, such as ”best” and ”leading”.
We further attach the facial meshes to evaluate the lip synchronization at the right part.
In comparison with other methods, our model produces expressions that are accompanied by more precise lip shapes and more natural facial motions.</p>

Undoubtedly, our method excels in other methods mainly in three aspects: semantic and gesture alignment, rhythm and gesture consistency, and content and facial expression synchronization.
Additionally, the coordination among various body parts is not easily depicted in Figs. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.1.3 Metrics ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.1.3 Metrics ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we further provide evaluation results in subsequent user studies.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is widely acknowledged that assessing the quality of generative tasks is inherently subjective.
Despite that we have evaluated with multiple quantitative metrics, there remains a
significant gap between such and human visual perception.
To this end, we conduct a user study to compare our framework with two recent baselines, TalkSHOW and EMAGE.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, we randomly select 100 synthesized samples of Scott, including various neutral and emotional clips.
Then we recruit 100 subjects with diverse backgrounds to select the most preferred motions in terms of the whole-body <span id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">coordination</span>, holistic <span id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">coherence</span>, and <span id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">synchronization</span> of the expression and gesture with the audio for the shuffled visual results.
Besides, in order to help the subjects get used to our questionnaire, we discard the answers of the first three samples and append them in the end to allow participants to get used to the task (test on 103 clips and take the last 100 answers).
The results are shown in Tab. <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table III ‣ 4.3 Verification on X-Adapter ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, our generated holistic motions are dominantly preferred on all three metrics over the competing baselines, especially on coordination and synchronization, which aligns with the superior performance observed in FMD, FGD, and MSE as illustrated in the Tab. <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table I ‣ 4.1.4 Baselines ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> and Tab. <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table II ‣ 4.2.1 Quantitative Results ‣ 4.2 Verification on DU-Trans ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.
Thus it can be concluded that DU-Trans extracts the distinctive features of both the face and body while enhancing the harmony between them.
Overall, our approach is capable of generating more coordinated, coherent, and synchronized motions that humans prefer.</p>

Specifically, we train two models with our framework: 1) trained with neutral data via DU-Trans; 2) pretrained with neutral data via DU-Trans and then finetuned with emotional data with our <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>-Adapter.
During the test, we randomly sample an emotional clip from the Scott test splits and visualize the velocities of the motions generated by three models, and compare them to the ground truth.
We observe that the neutral model outputs a limited dynamic and varied motion, but after fine-tuning, it aligns closely with the motion patterns of the ground truth, indicating that the emotion transfer is quite effective.
Then, we report the quantitative results in Tab. <a href="#S4.T4" title="Table IV ‣ 4.3.1 Analysis on Emotion Transfer ‣ 4.3 Verification on X-Adapter ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> consistent with the aforementioned conclusions, models from the neutral domain do not perform well on emotional data, as evidenced by their lower performance on all metrics at row Pretrain(Neu), and conversely, after fine-tuning, the performance has seen an overall enhancement as shown in row Finetune(Neu<math id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\rightarrow" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">→</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">→</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\rightarrow</annotation></semantics></math>Emo).

As mentioned in Sec. <a href="#S3.SS4" title="3.4 Conditional Editing based on X-Adapter ‣ 3 Method ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.4</span></a>, our framework allows multi-modal emotion editing.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.3 Verification on X-Adapter ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>(a), given neutral audio and multi-modal emotional conditions, we consistently generate gestures that accurately reflect the emotional cues contained in various guidance, including image, audio, motion sequence, and text.
For example, our method produces lowered hand movements that are associated with the sadness depicted in a sad image, <em id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span>, graves, whereas it generates a variety of large gestures with rhythmic body swaying when given a happy audio.
Similarly, our method also successfully captures key actions from the surprise motion sequence, such as more frequent body turns and hurried upward gestures.
For angry text, it includes more abrupt downward pressing gestures.
Additionally, in the fifth column, we display facial meshes at a certain word under different emotions.
It is evident that emotions do not interfere with the articulation of speech content, as can be seen from the relatively consistent mouth shapes, but they do influence the overall expression.
For instance, when happy, the corners of the mouth turn upwards, and when surprised, the mouth opens wide.
Thus, our method allows for precise emotion control of motion generation through any modality, flexibly supporting editing needs in various situations.</p>

In addition to the above, we supplement a qualitative study to demonstrate that the emotion space under the CLIP domain possesses a certain degree of generalization ability, thanks to the rich semantics inherited from CLIP. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.3 Verification on X-Adapter ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>(a), row 6 shows the results of the given <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">happily surprised</span> in text prompts.
This is an unseen compound emotion, and the generated motions accurately convey happiness and surprise simultaneously, which can be observed from the overall lively body movements and astonished expressions. Besides, by comparing the facial details with those of happy (row 3) or surprised (row 4), the result of this unseen style is not a mere replication of either but rather a full combination of both. This experiment verifies the flexibility and rich semantic priors of the CLIP feature space.</p>

Similar to Sec. <a href="#S4.SS3.SSS1" title="4.3.1 Analysis on Emotion Transfer ‣ 4.3 Verification on X-Adapter ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3.1</span></a>, we perform qualitative and quantitative experiments to verify the effectiveness of <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>-Adapter in identity transfer.
First, we visualize the motion velocity curves for four methods, <em id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text"></span>, ground truth, Scott model, Nidal model, and the Nidal model after finetuned on Scott data, when each receives a randomly sampled Scott audio signal.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3 Verification on X-Adapter ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>(b), Nidal usually speaks in a calm and quiet manner, which corresponds to the motion curve displaying a smooth low-amplitude trajectory, as colored in orange.
On the other hand, our fast adaption helps to transfer to the lively and dynamic Scott style, <em id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text"></span>, the light blue curve exhibits similar variations and intensities to the ground truth in green and the Scott model in blue.
Second, we attach the quantitative results in Tab. <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table V ‣ 4.3.2 Analysis on Identity Transfer ‣ 4.3 Verification on X-Adapter ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a> to support the above observations. Concretely, row Pretrain(N) demonstrates that direct cross-identity evaluation does not yield satisfactory results, while slight fine-tuning can achieve competitive performance compared to a model sufficiently trained from scratch, as shown by comparing row Pretrain(S) and row Finetune(N<math id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\rightarrow" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">→</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">→</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\rightarrow</annotation></semantics></math>S).</p>

To further verify that our method is robust to the choice of source identity and can be transferred to any other identity, we provide a cross-identity transfer analysis. Specifically, we construct three identity pairs with significant gaps: 1) Nidal and Scott have different personalities, one being quiet and the other being lively; 2) Wayne and Scott, although similar in temperament, have different behavioral habits; 3) Hailing and Scott have different genders.

Besides, we supplement the intuitive visualizations in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.3 Verification on X-Adapter ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>(b).
In line with the above, each person exhibits their own unique movement dynamics.
Nidal (row 1) shows less variety in his movements and changes slowly. Wayne (row 3) is accustomed to swinging his arms and speaking while facing to the left. Hailing (row 5) possesses a characteristically feminine grace.
After efficient finetuning (rows 2, 4, 6), our approach successfully adjusts the movement patterns to match Scott’s, no matter the initial state.

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this part, we provide a detailed analysis to demonstrate that <span id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>-Adapter can efficiently adapt the pretrained DU-Trans of Scott neutral data to alternative identity or emotion, even with limited training data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, we emphasize that our finetuning only updates about 4M parameters for both identity and emotion adaptation, in which the adapter is 3.73M and three heads are 0.27 M, while the total number of parameters is around 40M, meaning we only utilize 10% of the trainable parameters yet achieve superior performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, we analyze the efficiency of our finetuning on training <em id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">time</em> and <em id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data</em>.
Specifically, we conduct periodic tests every 15 minutes during the identity and emotion transfer process to evaluate the tuning time and data efficiency and record the MSE metric for face expression and BC metric for body gesture at each time point.
Comparing our method to EMAGE, we plot the leading value in Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 4.3.2 Analysis on Identity Transfer ‣ 4.3 Verification on X-Adapter ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.
Specifically, our method outperforms SOTA results within 45 minutes with full or half data, and can also achieve the best output with just a quarter of the data within 90 minutes.
Notably, we open all parameters of DU-Trans and use full data for finetuning (as shown in green color), but its performance is not as good as parameter-efficient finetuning (as shown in deep blue color), even costing many trainable parameters.
Beyond the above, we find that: 1) the time required for facial performance to reach comparable levels is relatively shorter than that for gestures, as expressions only involve a small range of facial movements, whereas gestures encompass a larger scope. For example, just 15 minutes of fine-tuning is sufficient for our method to surpass the SOTA competitor on the MSE metric;
2) in contrast to finetuning with a limited dataset, employing the full dataset can swiftly improve performance in a short period, but as time progresses, it typically saturates at a comparable level in the end.
To sum up, users can dynamically adjust the finetuning duration based on the amount of data available.</p>

The insight of our DU-Trans is to use divided encoders to ensure sufficient exhibition for both face and body, followed by a united decoder to implicitly model their interconnections and to directly predict the combined coefficients for overall high coordination.

The results indicate that neither of them yields satisfactory outputs.
The underlying reason may be that the two separate encoders do not account for each other’s influence, which is evident from the significant degradation in FMD.
Directly employing a single decoder may cause two distinct distributions to converge toward each other, ensuring harmony but greatly sacrificing the uniqueness of each, especially as indicated by the decline in FGD and MSE.
We also give a visualization in Fig. <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 4.3.3 Tuning Efficiency ‣ 4.3 Verification on X-Adapter ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> that the motion generated by this method has a minimal amplitude.
Then, we explore how to preserve individual differences while achieving a harmonious commonality.

We explore how to insert the added adapter into the original network by comparing the parallel and sequential instances.
As shown in rows Serial and Parallel, the parallel form outperforms the sequential one in all metrics. This could be attributed to the parallel adapter receiving the same input as the sub-layers and directly updating the output, which is a more intuitive and natural design.
This approach minimally impacts the original model, as the adapter operates independently of the sub-layer outputs.
Moreover, we attempt to reduce the use of adapters to reduce the number of trainable parameters.
However, from rows Only MHA and Only FFN, we observe that fine-tuning only the adapters inserted into either the FFN or MHA leads to a certain degree of performance decline under the same training settings.
Thus, we incorporate our <span id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>-Adapter for <em id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">both</em> the FFN and MHA.</p>

It is essential to incorporate the corresponding conditions to control the fine-tuning of emotions or identities.
As shown in this part, when the injection of conditions is removed (row w/o. <span id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>), all metrics exhibit degradation, indicating that conditions can guide the network to better express the desired information.
Moreover, the absence of conditions can also lead to a loss of editing capabilities during the inference phase.
We further explore how to integrate the conditions.
An intuitive approach is to use a stylization method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite>, mapping the conditions into the scale and shift factors to affect the original features, as shown in row Stylization.
Although introducing this module enhances performance, it significantly increases the number of trainable parameters, <em id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text"></span>, from 4M to 8.14M.
To balance the performance and cost, we continue to experiment with an extreme case, directly adding the condition to the original features without adding any trainable parameters.
To our delight, we find that this simple method can achieve comparable results. Therefore, we employ the addition manner to exert the influence of conditions.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Analysis on Scale Form (Tab. <a href="#S4.T6" title="Table VI ‣ 4.3.2 Analysis on Identity Transfer ‣ 4.3 Verification on X-Adapter ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>(b) Scale part).</span>
We introduce a dynamic scale mechanism (Dy-Scale) in <span id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>-Adapter to dynamically adjust the original features
by considering the significance score of the tunable features.
To verify its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on two ablated variations: the fixed scalar scale which is set to 1.0 (row Scalar-1.0), and the learnable scalar scale which is initialized by 1.0 (row L-Scalar).
As shown in this part, our Dy-Scale yields the best performance with a negligible increase in tunable parameters, from 3.99M to 4.00M.
Thus, for such complex temporal motions, learning an adaptive weight for each frame is an intuitive and effective strategy.
We further visualize the ratio of updated tokens in each layer for both MHA and FFN to explore the mechanism of Dy-Scale.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 4.4.1 Ablation on DU-Trans ‣ 4.4 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, the <em id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">same</em> audio input exhibits similar changes across different layers of MHA and FFN under various emotional conditions, but the specific ratios are entirely distinct.
The neutral output from the fine-tuned model has only a few activated tokens because it shares similar motion patterns as the neutral output from the pre-trained model.
In contrast, the emotional output is entirely different, which can also be discerned from the adjustment ratio.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">

To further prove the effectiveness of our proposed <span id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>-Adapter, we compare it with several PEFT approaches, <em id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text"></span>, Prefix Tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> and LoRA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, under the same training time and data.
Specifically, prefix tuning involves prepending 64 learnable tokens in the temporal dimension and adding the conditions to them.
From row Prefix Tuning, it is evident that this manner does not achieve effective transfer.
While the number of trainable parameters is minimal, it cannot be ignored that an increase in the number of tokens also leads to a substantial increase in memory consumption. Besides, to ensure a fair comparison, we adapt Dy-Scale and the condition in the same manner as LoRA.
We set the rank <math id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="r" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">r</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1">𝑟</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1c">r</annotation></semantics></math> for both to be 64 thus the tunable parameters are the same.
By comparing rows LoRA-r64 and Adapter-r64, the overall performance of the <span id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>-Adapter is superior to that of LoRA.
Furthermore, we attempt to increase the rank to 128.
As observed in rows Adapter-r128 and Adapter-r64, while the number of trainable parameters has increased, there is a noticeable improvement in overall performance.
The potential reason may be that complex motion patterns require more parameters to be well-fitted during the fine-tuning phase. Experimentally, we employ the proposed <span id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>-Adapter with rank set to 128 in the full version.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we focus on enhancing the user experience with talking avatars, concentrating on the harmony of full-body movements and the rapid adaptation of new identity and emotional data.
To achieve such, we propose <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter">Combo</span>, which includes two critical designs:
1) DU-Trans operates by initially dividing into dual pathways designed to independently learn the distinct features of the face and body, each guided by auxiliary losses and enriched with holistic dynamic priors through the Bi-Flow layer. Then, it unites the learned two features to model a joint distribution and directly predicts the combined coefficients that ensure a high degree of coordinated holistic motions.
2) <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">X</span>-Adapter seamlessly integrates into a pretrained DU-Trans network that can quickly transfer the original model to an emotional one or other totally different identities with much fewer trainable parameters.
Our approach has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets, along with an efficient ability to transfer identities and emotions.</p>

First, since we do not perform targeted design for the foot trajectory, the motion generated by our method exhibits physical implausibilities of foot sliding.
We plan to introduce explicit physical modeling to mitigate this issue.
Second, due to the limitations of BEAT2 and SHOW datasets, we are unable to generate highly photo-realistic avatars, which is crucial for enhancing the user experience.
We aim to develop a large-scale multi-view full-body talking avatar dataset to prompt the advancement of this field.</p>
