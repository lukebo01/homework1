<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">The task of audio-driven portrait animation involves generating a talking head video using an identity image and an audio track of speech. While many existing approaches focus on lip synchronization and video quality, few tackle the challenge of generating emotion-driven talking head videos. The ability to control and edit emotions is essential for producing expressive and realistic animations. In response to this challenge, we propose EMOdiffhead, a novel method for emotional talking head video generation that not only enables fine-grained control of emotion categories and intensities but also enables one-shot generation. Given the FLAME 3D model’s linearity in expression modeling, we utilize the DECA method to extract expression vectors, that are combined with audio to guide a diffusion model in generating videos with precise lip synchronization and rich emotional expressiveness. This approach not only enables the learning of rich facial information from emotion-irrelevant data
but also facilitates the generation of emotional videos. It effectively overcomes the limitations of emotional data, such as the lack of diversity in facial and background information, and addresses the absence of emotional details in emotion-irrelevant data. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other emotion portrait animation methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The task of audio-driven portrait animation involves creating a talking head video using an identity image of the speaker and an audio track of their speech content, that has a wide range of applications. For example, it can serve as a means of human-computer interaction and is widely used in digital assistants, film-making, and virtual video conferences.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of AI-generated content, especially generative adversarial networks (GAN) and diffusion models, talking head generation has become a research hotspot in recent years due to its profound application prospects. Most of the previous works focused on solving lip synchronization and video quality issues, and only a few works explored generating emotion-related videos. However, the task of emotion-driven talking head generation is a key aspect in producing animated faces that are not only realistic but also capable of conveying a wide range of emotions with remarkable expressiveness. Although some talking head generation studies focus on incorporating facial emotions, they are unable to flexibly edit these expressions, such as adjusting the intensity of the expression.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">When it comes to emotion-driven talking head generation, early works such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> use one-hot emotion label as the emotion source, without the capability of intensity editing. EVP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> presents a disentanglement method to separate emotion latent feature representation from speech for implicitly controlling the emotion of synthesized video. However, the effective representation of latent emotions in EVP depends on the accuracy of the speech content and emotion disentanglement method, thus it is difficult to achieve emotion control entirely relying on speech alone. Moreover, it is also inconvenient if the input emotion source depends on other videos <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, since finding a video with the desired emotional style may not always be feasible. For instance, finding the desired emotional video requires considering factors such as resolution, occlusion, and even the length relationship between the video and audio. In addition, large-scale emotion-irrelevant audio-visual datasets are more easily available than emotional data. These data are typically collected in the wild, therefore containing diverse facial and background information, that is beneficial to enhance the model’s generalization performance. Therefore, there exist two key issues that need to be addressed. <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(1) How to effectively and flexibly control the emotions of synthesized videos?</span> <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(2) How to effectively learn emotional information from emotion-irrelevant data to improve generalization performance?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the challenge mentioned above, we propose the method EMOdiffhead that can explicitly and continuously edit the emotion of talking head video, achieving fine-grained control as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ EMOdiffhead: Continuously Emotional Control in Talking Head Generation via Diffusion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Specifically, given that the FLAME 3D model allows for linear editing in expression modeling, we employ the DECA method to reconstruct the facial geometry from the video. It enables us to extract the expression vector and create a training pair consisting of the video’s emotion label and the corresponding expression vector. Subsequently, given the input audio and expression vector, a time-based denoising network is trained to generate a video matching the input. For maintaining the consistency of the target subject, ReferenceNet is introduced to extract the feature map of the target identity that is to be integrated into the denoising network through cross-attention. To synthesize videos that match emotions and intensities during inference, the above emotion label and expression vector pairs are used to train an expression vector generator. Next, the synthesized neutral expression vector and the target emotional expression vector generated by the generator are used to compute the final expression input vector. It is then used to condition the denoising network to synthesize videos that correspond to the desired emotions and their intensities.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Audio-driven talking head generation is a technique that employs audio to generate facial animations or expressions that correspond to the audio content. It can be divided into two types, i.e., <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Person-specific</span> and <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Person-independent</span>. Person-specific talking face generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> have the advantage of producing high-resolution talking face videos since the identity is included in the training data. However, a drawback of the Person-specific approach is that the model is difficult to generalize to other identities. Therefore, Person-independent methods have emerged to solve this problem. Person-independent approaches that can generalize to arbitrary faces are trained on large-scale audio-visual datasets with diverse faces, lighting, and backgrounds, such as Voxceleb <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In previous works, Chung et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> first generate talking faces in a one-shot manner. Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and Zhou et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> improve on this scheme by leveraging facial landmarks as intermediate representations. Zhou et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> further incorporate pose control into the one-shot setting. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and Ren et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> use 3D coefficient representation for one-shot generation. Despite these advancements, these methods still struggle to generate animations with varying emotional expressions.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the focus has expanded to controlling the emotions of the output subject. Because emotions play a vital role in realistic animation. Eskimez et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and Sinha et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> employ a one-hot emotion label to generate an emotional talking face but the method is unable to control the intensity of emotion. EVP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> presents a disentanglement approach to decouple content and emotion information from speech for implicitly controlling the emotion of output video. However, the method cannot be applied to unseen subjects and audio. Furthermore, these methods for generating emotional talking faces trained on the emotional audio-visual datasets CREMA-D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and MEAD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> have limited generalization capability due to the low diversity of these datasets. For the one-shot method, EAMM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> achieves accurate emotional control of synthesized videos by using emotional features extracted from reference videos, but it is not flexible. Although Tan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> use user-friendly text descriptions to specify the desired emotional style, they cannot achieve fine-grained control. In contrast, our proposed method EMOdiffhead can achieve fine-grained emotion control and remains effective for arbitrary identities.</p>

For each frame in talking head video, the DECA method can regress the FLAME parameters of human face, including the parameters of identity shape <math id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\boldsymbol{\beta}\in\mathbb{R}^{100}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">𝜷</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">∈</mo><msup id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">ℝ</mi><mn id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">100</mn></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><in id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></in><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜷</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">ℝ</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">100</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\boldsymbol{\beta}\in\mathbb{R}^{100}</annotation></semantics></math>, expression <math id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\boldsymbol{\psi}\in\mathbb{R}^{50}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">𝝍</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">∈</mo><msup id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">ℝ</mi><mn id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml">50</mn></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1"><in id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"></in><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝝍</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2">ℝ</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3">50</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1c">\boldsymbol{\psi}\in\mathbb{R}^{50}</annotation></semantics></math> and head pose <math id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\boldsymbol{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{6}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">𝜽</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">∈</mo><msup id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.2.cmml">ℝ</mi><mn id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.cmml">6</mn></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1"><in id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1"></in><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2">𝜽</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.2">ℝ</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3">6</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1c">\boldsymbol{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{6}</annotation></semantics></math>, etc. Subsequently, the expression vector <math id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\boldsymbol{\psi}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">𝝍</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1">𝝍</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1c">\boldsymbol{\psi}</annotation></semantics></math> from the training video is then used as an additional emotional condition, embedded into the process of talking head synthesis.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the challenge of generation quality and model
generalization, diffusion models with strong generative capabilities are utilized to synthesize talking head videos. To synchronize the generated video with the driving audio and match the corresponding intensity of emotions, we inject additional audio embeddings and emotion embeddings during the progressive denoising process. Additionally, we employ a UNet architecture, similar to the denoising backbone network but without temporal information, to extract identity features. These features are then used to perform cross-attention calculations with the corresponding layers in the backbone network, ensuring identity consistency in the generated video. Finally, the output video undergoes super-resolution module processing to obtain high-resolution photo-realistic talking head video.</p>

The diffusion process progressively adds noise to the data, effectively destroying its structure, while the denoising process learns to reverse this by restoring the data. In practice, only the denoising process is trained and used during the inference stage, where it generates data by iteratively refining a sample of Gaussian noise through multiple denoising steps.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2" class="ltx_p">Since large-scale audio-visual datasets generally contain a wide range of videos with different emotion types and intensities but lack corresponding labels, using the expression vector corresponding to each video frame as a condition during training can guide the backbone network to synthesize videos with varying emotions. At the same time, due to the linear editing characteristics of the FLAME model in the expression space (shown as Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.2.2 Model Architecture ‣ 3.2 Photo-realistic Talking Head Synthesis ‣ 3 Method ‣ EMOdiffhead: Continuously Emotional Control in Talking Head Generation via Diffusion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>), when given a series of expression vectors that continuously change along the direction from neutral emotions to non-neutral emotions, e.g., angry, contempt, disgusted, fear, happy, sad and surprised during inference, our network can synthesize expressions continuously changing talking head videos. Specifically, given a pair of expression vectors, one corresponds to neutral emotion and the other corresponds to target non-neutral emotion, we can calculate the editing direction vector for target non-neutral emotion.

Thus we devise a UNet with a similar structure to the backbone network termed ReferenceNet, that is used to extract image features of identity frames. Specifically, the ReferenceNet is the same as the backbone network except that it does not utilize conditional residual blocks to introduce condition information such as time, audio, and expressions. Given that both ReferenceNet and the backbone network originate from the same UNet architecture, the feature maps generated by these two structures at specific layers exhibit similarities, facilitating feature maps from the two structures to fusion. In our case, the feature map of each layer extracted by the ReferenceNet is integrated into the backbone network through cross-attention. Furthermore, after performing cross-attention calculations, we introduce spatial attention to force the model to focus on important regions in the feature maps, thereby more effectively extracting useful features.</p>

In our case, we also focus on the eyes and surrounding areas, as they are often closely associated with changes in emotional expression. Additionally, we use an additional eye loss to force the model to pay more attention to the eyes and surrounding region. Specifically, we use facial landmarks to locate the position of the mouth and eyes, and during training, we minimize the distance loss between the noise added to these regions and the predicted noise. With the utilization of spatial attention mentioned above, the model can effectively synthesize videos synchronized with given audio and expression conditions. Therefore, the final loss function can be expressed as:</p>

In the initial inference phase, we duplicate the identity image to serve as the motion frame for the denoising network.

Ultimately, these synthesized video frames are concatenated and passed through a super-resolution module to produce the final output talking head video.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The study consists of two experimental phases, training, and inference, conducted on a computing device equipped with four 3090 GPUs. The training procedure is divided into two parts, namely the training of the expression generator and the denoising network. For the expression generator, we select videos with the highest emotion intensity from the MEAD dataset for face reconstruction to extract the expression vectors used in training. For the denoising network, to improve training efficiency, we randomly select one video for each character in the MEAD dataset under each emotion category and intensity level, while also incorporating the HDTF dataset for training. The remaining data, not used in training, is reserved for evaluating the model’s generalization performance. In our case, the denoising network employs the same architecture as the UNet proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The network input is images with size (128x128), that are downsampled twice to feature maps with size (64x64) and (32x32) respectively. Then, after skip connection and upsampling operations, a target frame of the same size as the input is obtained. To reduce computational costs, we only perform cross-attention calculations between the ReferenceNet and the backbone network when the feature map size is 64 and 32.</p>

Moreover, linearity of intensity editing (LIE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> is introduced to assess the linearity of EMOdiffhead’s emotion editing capabilities. LIE is calculated using the pairwise perceptual difference between adjacent images with gradually changing facial expressions, based on the LPIPS model. However, the facial features extracted by LPIPS span multiple levels, from low-level visual elements to high-level semantic information, covering a broad spectrum of facial characteristics. Thus using LPIPS to evaluate the linear editing of expressions has certain limitations. To address the issue, we propose a novel metric called Flame-based linearity of intensity editing (FLIE). Given a neutral emotion vector and a target non-neutral emotion vector, our model generates a series of talking face videos where the intensity of the expressions increases linearly from 0 to 1. The DECA method is then employed to extract the expression vectors from all video frames. The difference between the average expression vectors of adjacent intensities is subsequently used to compute FLIE, which is defined as the sum of the coefficients of variation as follows:</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we quantitatively analyze the emotion editing capabilities of the proposed method and present some editing results for different emotion types and intensities shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.3 Evaluation Metric ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ EMOdiffhead: Continuously Emotional Control in Talking Head Generation via Diffusion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. To evaluate our method, we compare it with several state-of-the-art methods, i.e., MEAD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, EVP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and EmoSpeaker <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> with emotion editing ability. Since the intensity levels of emotional face videos synthesized by different methods vary. For instance, MEAD supports only 3 intensity levels, whereas EMOspeaker allows for continuous intensity adjustment. Thus we set different intensity levels in our output videos to ensure fairness when compared with other methods. The results of this comparison are presented in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.3.3 Training Loss ‣ 3.3 Emotion Editing Condition Generation ‣ 3 Method ‣ EMOdiffhead: Continuously Emotional Control in Talking Head Generation via Diffusion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, demonstrating that our method outperforms most existing approaches in terms of EmoAcc and linearity of intensity editing.</p>

As shown in Table <a href="#S3.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 3.3.3 Training Loss ‣ 3.3 Emotion Editing Condition Generation ‣ 3 Method ‣ EMOdiffhead: Continuously Emotional Control in Talking Head Generation via Diffusion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, our proposed method performs well in terms of overall video quality and lip synchronization, and only the FID score is slightly inferior to EVP. The EVP method first generates facial landmarks and then projects them onto the edge image of the target video through 3D reconstruction. Finally, the synthesized video is obtained through rendering. Therefore, it achieves a head posture that more closely resembles that of the target video. Additionally, we observed that the faces generated by EAMM differ significantly from the reference image, and emotion control relies heavily on the reference video, making it extremely inconvenient. MEAD and EVP also lack accuracy in lip movements and are unable to produce emotionally expressive videos with fine-grained control. In contrast, our proposed method ensures a high degree of lip synchronization and richer emotional expression while maintaining video quality.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct a user study to compare EMOdiffhead with other SOTA methods. Specifically, 20 participants are invited to assess four methods’ results and ground truth videos in terms of emotion accuracy, audio-visual synchronization, identity consistency, and video quality. When participants are presented with 5 videos from different methods (including ground truth video), they are required to rate the above four criteria on a scale of 1 to 5. The obtained scores are averaged to get the final result reported in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.5 User Study ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ EMOdiffhead: Continuously Emotional Control in Talking Head Generation via Diffusion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.

During inference, it is only necessary to generate the target emotion expression and the neutral emotion expression, and any desired intensity level of emotional expression can then be produced according to Equations <a href="#S3.E14" title="Equation 14 ‣ 3.2.2 Model Architecture ‣ 3.2 Photo-realistic Talking Head Synthesis ‣ 3 Method ‣ EMOdiffhead: Continuously Emotional Control in Talking Head Generation via Diffusion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">14</span></a> and <a href="#S3.E15" title="Equation 15 ‣ 3.2.2 Model Architecture ‣ 3.2 Photo-realistic Talking Head Synthesis ‣ 3 Method ‣ EMOdiffhead: Continuously Emotional Control in Talking Head Generation via Diffusion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>. In the discriminator setup, we employ TCN blocks in the global discriminator to enhance the temporal dynamics of the generated emotional conditions.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present EMOdiffhead, a novel method for emotion-driven talking head video generation that provides fine-grained control over both emotion type and intensity. Given the linearity of the FLAME model in facial expression modeling, we employ the DECA method to extract expression vectors, which guide the diffusion model in generating videos synchronized with emotion. EMOdiffhead effectively overcomes the limitations of emotional data, such as the lack of diversity in facial and background information, and addresses the absence of emotional details in emotion-irrelevant data. It not only provides fine-grained control over facial expressions but also supports one-shot generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering significant advancements in the field of emotion-driven portrait animation.</p>
