<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Current research in synthesized speech detection primarily focuses on the generalization of detection systems to unknown spoofing methods of noise-free speech. However, the performance of anti-spoofing countermeasures (CM) system is often don’t work as well in more challenging scenarios, such as those involving noise and reverberation. To address the problem of enhancing the robustness of CM systems, we propose a transfer learning-based speech enhancement front-end joint optimization (TL-SEJ) method, investigating its effectiveness in improving robustness against noise and reverberation. We evaluated the proposed method’s performance through a series of comparative and ablation experiments. The experimental results show that, across different signal-to-noise ratio test conditions, the proposed TL-SEJ method improves recognition accuracy by 2.7% to 15.8% compared to the baseline. Compared to conventional data augmentation methods, our system achieves an accuracy improvement ranging from 0.7% to 5.8% in various noisy conditions and from 1.7% to 2.8% under different RT60 reverberation scenarios. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances system robustness in noisy and reverberant conditions.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, voice conversion (VC) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies leveraging deep learning have achieved remarkable progress <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. These speech synthesis technologies can now produce high-quality, natural, and expressive human-like speech that is nearly indistinguishable from actual human voices. While these innovations provide significant benefits across various domains, their potential misuse poses serious threats to automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems, and can endanger social security, political stability, and economic integrity. As a result, there has been considerable focus on developing synthesized speech anti-spoofing countermeasure (CM) systems to address these risks. A typical CM system pipeline, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Enhancing Anti-spoofing Countermeasures Robustness through Joint Optimization and Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, includes a pre-processing module, a feature extractor, and a back-end classifier. If the feature extraction operation and the back-end classifier are integrated, with the waveform as the input, it can be considered an end-to-end model.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since 2015, the ASVspoof community has organized anti-spoofing challenges biennially, holding four events consecutively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. These challenges have significantly advanced spoofing detection technologies. Among them, the ASVspoof 2019 challenge is notable for its comprehensive approach, addressing all three major spoofing attack types: text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion (VC), and replay attacks. The logical access (LA) dataset from ASVspoof 2019, widely used in current research, includes genuine speech from the Voice Cloning Toolkit (VCTK) corpus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The spoofed data is generated using advanced TTS and VC technologies developed in recent years, utilizing speech data from other speakers within the VCTK dataset to prevent data leakage. Since the VCTK corpus was recorded in a studio environment, the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset is also widely regarded as a clean, noise-free dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In studies based on clean datasets, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Enhancing Anti-spoofing Countermeasures Robustness through Joint Optimization and Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(a), various strategies have been explored at the feature extractor or back-end classifier stages to enhance the performance of CM systems for synthesized speech detection. For the feature extractor stage, the purpose of feature extraction is to learn discriminative features by capturing audio artifacts present in speech signals. Researchers have investigated the impact of different hand-crafted or prosodic features as inputs and have achieved moderate performance. Such as Constant Q Transform (CQT) , Constant Q Cepstral Coefficients (CQCC) , Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFCC) , Log Mel-Filter Bank (FBANK), and fundamental frequency (F0) . Additionally, neural network-based front-ends have been utilized to extract deep features from raw waveform input. Tak et al.  employed SincNet  as the first layer of their end-to-end anti-spoofing model called RawNet2. Furthermore, self-supervised embedding features from pre-trained models like Wav2vec  and Hubert , which are trained using only bona fide speech data, have been explored for their potential to enhance spoofing detection performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the back-end classifier phase, diverse classification approaches have been explored, including conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)  and Neural Network (NN)-based models, such as Light Convolutional Neural Network (LCNN) , Deep Residual Network (ResNet) , and Graph neural networks (GNNs) . GMM has been widely used as a baseline model in a series of competitions, such as ASVspoof 2017, 2019, and 2021. However, most NN-based models outperform the GMM-based classifier due to their powerful modeling capabilities . In addition to improving CM system performance through model architecture enhancements, there are also approaches that modify training strategies or introduce new loss functions. For instance, Xue et al.  proposed a self-distillation network, where the deepest network instructs shallower networks to enhance their ability to capture fine-grained information. Wang et al.  introduced the adaptive and hyper-parameter-free Probability-to-Similarity Gradient (P2SGrad) into the synthesized speech detection task, utilizing the mean-square-error (MSE) loss function.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, some research has integrated feature extractor and classisifer into end-to-end systems. Notable examples of these comprehensive systems include Spectro-Temporal Graph Attention Network (RawGAT-ST)  , Audio Anti-Spoofing using Integrated Spectro-Temporal Graph Attention Networks (AASIST)  , and Rawformer . These end-to-end approaches aim to modelling local and global artefacts and relationship directly on raw audio, enhance the perception of frequency and time domain features, and potentially improve overall detection performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Besides improving the detection precision of the CM system on clean data, some studies have also focused on enhancing the robustness of synthesized speech detection (SSD) tasks. For example, the ASVspoof 2021 logical access challenge was designed to explore SSD under audio channel coding and compression conditions. Research on robustness using this dataset mainly concentrates on the preprocessing and feature extraction phases of the pipeline. In the preprocessing phase, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Enhancing Anti-spoofing Countermeasures Robustness through Joint Optimization and Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(a), data augmentation is the most commonly used technique to enhance model robustness. For instance, Tek et al.  proposed the RawBoost data augmentation method, which is tailored for telephony scenarios and requires no additional data sources, effectively improving the robustness of CM systems to compression. In the feature extraction phase, Wang et al.  introduced preprocessing methods such as band trimming, band-pass filtering, and band extension to identify suitable sub-band widths for coding and compression-robust SSD tasks. Furthermore, Tian et al.  generated their own training and test data subsets based on the ASVspoof 2015 dataset by adding noise and reverberation to the clean data, thereby exploring the robustness of CM systems with different feature inputs. Their investigations demonstrated that environmental noise and reverberation can significantly degrade the performance of CM systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">This study builds upon our previous work . In our earlier research, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Enhancing Anti-spoofing Countermeasures Robustness through Joint Optimization and Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(b), we innovatively introduced speech enhancement as a front-end module to the audio anti-spoofing task, demonstrating its impact on the performance of back-end CM systems. Additionally, we proposed a joint training framework for the SSD task, optimizing both the Unet-based speech enhancement front-end and the audio anti-spoofing back-end models jointly, and conducted preliminary validations under specific noisy conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that speech enhancement front-end have been employed for noise-robust SSD task. While the results were promising, the study had some limitations. Specifically, the previous research only addressed environmental noise and did not consider the impact of reverberation. Additionally, the data were generated offline for each noise condition, and separate models were trained for each scenario. This implementation setting limited the ability to assess the models’ generalization performance and noise robustness in more realistic settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, to improve performance in noisy scenarios, we first further investigate the impact of pre-trained models on both noise and reverberation robustness of CM systems. We propose a transfer learning-based speech enhancement front-end joint optimization (TL-SEJ) method. By employing transfer learning techniques at the back-end model, we integrate pre-trained information into the previously proposed joint training framework, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Enhancing Anti-spoofing Countermeasures Robustness through Joint Optimization and Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(e), thereby enhancing the model’s robustness to noise. Since self-supervised pre-trained models require raw audio as input and cannot be directly connected to the Unet front-end, we use the Conformer model pre-trained on the automatic speech recognition (ASR) task as the back-end model in this approach. This allows the CM system to retain the capability for joint optimization with speech enhancement while incorporating pre-trained information. Additionally, we use the Unet front-end’s output noise mask instead of directly restoring spectral features, extending the system’s robustness to non-additive noise such as reverberation. This approach aims to improve the overall performance and reliability of the CM system in various challenging acoustic environments. The key contributions of this work are as follows:</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To determine the authenticity of mixed speech signals with noise or reverberation, the most straightforward approach is to use data augmentation to enhance the diversity of training data, thereby improving the robustness of anti-spoofing networks, as shown in Figure 2(a). In our previous work, as illustrated in Figure 2(b), we introduced a speech enhancement front-end to the anti-spoofing task, achieving notable robustness in anti-spoofing CM systems. Additionally, as shown in Figure 2(c), models pre-trained on large datasets have learned prior knowledge from extensive and diverse data, which can significantly improve the robustness of downstream tasks.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data augmentation is a method used to generate additional training data for various neural networks. In speech-related tasks, references [9, 10] increased artificial data for low-resource ASR tasks. Reference [12] synthesized noisy audio by overlaying clean audio with noise signals. Reference [13] applied speed perturbation to the original Voxceleb audio to enrich the number of speakers. Reference [14] explored the use of an acoustic room simulator. In the SSD task, Qian et al. proposed multi-condition training based on data augmentation, allowing the model to access distorted training data. Cai and Li [15] used an online data augmentation method based on the MUSAN and RIR corpora to diversify frame-level data in deepfake boundary detection tasks. In this paper, for noise-based data augmentation, we follow the online noise simulation method using the MUSAN dataset as in [15]. However, for adding reverberation, we employ the latest online simulation methods to obtain richer room impulse responses (RIRs) and higher simulation efficiency.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to SSL pre-trained models, supervised pre-trained models have also achieved notable results in many downstream tasks. For example Cai and Li  utilized a pre-trained ASR Conformer encoder  to initialize the speaker embedding network, thereby enhancing the model’s generalization ability and reducing the risk of overfitting.
In this study, if we use an SSL pre-trained model as the backend following the speech enhancement network, it requires the speech enhancement network to output a complete time-domain audio signal.  indicates that fully reconstructing the time-domain signal may introduce new artifacts, increasing the training burden of the CM system. Moreover, SSL models usually have a large number of parameters, using an SSL model as a trainable backend rather than a freezing feature extractor requires fine-tuning, which significantly increases hardware and time costs. Therefore, we follow the transfer learning approach described in , using Conformer encoder pre-trained on the ASR task. By aggregating different levels of feature embeddings through the multi-scale feature aggregation (MFA) method, we conduct supervised training of the Conformer model on the downstream SSD task.

The problem of noise robustness cannot be ignored in any speech-related task, so many tasks use SE as an upstream process, using the reconstructed noise-free sound output from the SE network as input . There are also tasks that integrate the SE network into the model and train it as a whole , or enhance the model’s speech enhancement capability by changing the loss function . For the SSD task, Hanilci et al.  demonstrated that using noise-free sounds processed by a separate SE front-end as input to the CM system may increase the difficulty of training or degrade the system’s performance. This performance degradation might be because speech enhancement introduces musical noise and other processing artifacts that mask the synthesis or conversion artifacts. Therefore, in our previous work, we introduced the SE module simultaneously with the CM system as part of a joint optimization process. Instead of performing a full time-domain waveform reconstruction, we computed the mean square error (MSE) at the spectral features (FBANK), which could avoid some reconstruction artifacts .</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">U-Net is a classical model structure [11-15]. The basic components in this framework are the encoder, decoder, and skip connections. The encoder mainly down-samples the input speech features to obtain a higher-level speech embedding. The decoder is the inverse process of the encoder, up-sampling the speech feature map and ultimately outputting enhanced speech features with the same length as the original input. Skip connections link each encoding layer with its corresponding decoding layer, which helps to preserve features from each encoding layer to the decoding layer.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Enhancing Anti-spoofing Countermeasures Robustness through Joint Optimization and Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, to distinguish the authenticity of mixed speech signals with noise or reverberation, we summarize three training strategies that CM systems can use: data augmentation, speech enhancement, and utilizing pre-trained models. The methodology of this study is based on the SE front-end jointly optimisation method we previously proposed . In this paper, we have proposed a Dual-input Unet-based Masked feature Enhancement Network (DUMENet) to address the reverberation better, and a transfer learning-based speech enhancement front-end joint optimization (TL-SEJ) mothod to introducing pre-training model back-end learned prior knowledge for large-sclae dataset. These enhancements aim to address the limitations observed in the initial study.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.11" class="ltx_p">Data augmentation involves adding noise or reverberation to clean speech data, making the input speech more diverse. Models trained using data augmentation techniques have a stronger ability to handle complex signals. In this study, we use the officially provided ASVspoof 2019 LA train subset as the clean dataset, adding noise or reverberation to obtain the corresponding simulated mixed training data. A noisy speech signal can be represented as:</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose DUMENet, as shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 2.3 Speehc Enhancement ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Enhancing Anti-spoofing Countermeasures Robustness through Joint Optimization and Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, whose model structure is almost same as the Unet-based front-end SE network structure in our previous work . Inspired by the work of xxx et al.  on the joint training of SE front-ends with speaker embedding extractors in the ASV task, we concatenates the FBANK features of noisy speech with clean speech as the input at every training minibatch. Additionally, it uses the FBANK features of the clean source speech, concatenated twice, as labels. This dual-feature input approach enhances the similarity between the extracted clean and noisy speech embedding features during joint optimization of the front-end and back-end, thus avoiding additional artefacts while suppressing noise perturbations.
Unlike our previous work, DUMENet does not directly reconstruct the FBANK features of clean speech. Instead, it outputs a soft mask of the same shape as the input. This soft mask is element-wise multiplied with the input signal, and the resulting product is compared to the label using the MSE loss function. This approach aligns with the reverberation simulation principles mentioned in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Data Augmentation in the Preprocessing Stage ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Enhancing Anti-spoofing Countermeasures Robustness through Joint Optimization and Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>, further enhancing the performance of the CM system under reverberant conditions.

Figure 1 presents the Conformer encoder and block structure. A Conformer block is a sandwich structure of four modules stacked together: a feed-forward (FFN) module, a multi-headed self-attention (MHSA) module, a convolution module, and a second FFN module.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike Wang Xing et al., who used the large-scale self-supervised pre-trained model wav2vec2.0 as a front-end feature extractor for fine-tuning, performing transfer learning directly on the audio anti-spoofing back-end model significantly alters the distribution of the pre-trained model’s output representations, enabling more direct domain matching for complex audio anti-spoofing tasks.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The transfer learning process is shown in Algorithm 1. We load the pre-trained Conformer encoder parameters from the ASR task into the corresponding Conformer encoder of the MFA-Conformer structure for the audio anti-spoofing network back-end. Using multi-scale feature aggregation (MFA), we concatenate the output feature maps from each Conformer block, apply layer normalization to obtain frame-level high-level representations, and input these representations into an attentive statistics pooling (ASP) layer and a fully connected (FC) layer to obtain utterance-level spoofing detection embeddings. Finally, a linear classifier is attached for fine-tuning. Similar to training a general audio anti-spoofing network, we fine-tune the Conformer encoder and the linear classifier using a binary cross-entropy loss function on the audio anti-spoofing dataset, as given by:</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To compare the effectiveness of joint optimization, in addition to the MFA-Conformer mentioned in the previous section, we also use two different network structures as the audio anti-spoofing back-end models: LCNN [24] and ResNet18 [25]. Both structures are commonly used in the ASVSpoof 2021 challenge for audio anti-spoofing. The Max-Feature-Map (MFM) operation, based on the Max-Out activation function, is a fundamental component of LCNN. A Bi-LSTM layer is used in LCNN to aggregate utterance-level embeddings. For ResNet18, it is a lightweight version of ResNet. Detailed model structures and parameters of LCNN and ResNet can be found in Chapter <a href="#S5" title="5 Experiments ‣ Enhancing Anti-spoofing Countermeasures Robustness through Joint Optimization and Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. Similarly, to ensure fair comparison, all audio anti-spoofing back-ends in this study use the Attentive Statistic Pooling (ASP) [14] block to aggregate utterance-level embeddings. Binary cross-entropy loss, as shown in Equation 12, is used as the objective function.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Enhancing Anti-spoofing Countermeasures Robustness through Joint Optimization and Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(e), the TL-SEJ combines the three previously mentioned schemes by using on-the-fly data augmentation at the pre-processing stage to increase the diversity of input speech. The audio anti-spoofing back-end network uses a pre-trained Conformer model based on the ASR task to improve generalization performance. In between, we incorporate DUMENet to jointly optimize with the back-end network during training. This aims to reduce unknown additional artifacts due to the inconsistency between independent speech enhancement and anti-spoofing tasks, making the entire CM system more conducive to the deep embedding of the SSD task. Similar to the joint optimization loss used in our previous work, TL-SEJ also uses MSE loss and CE loss as a combined loss function, as shown below:</p>

The ASVspoof database is a series of data from the ASVspoof challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Among them, 19LA is one of the most widely used datasets by industry researchers. For this research, we use the ASVspoof 2019 LA (19LA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> datasets as our primary experimental dataset. Noisy and reverberant datasets are generated based on this dataset. The 19LA dataset consists mostly of clean data created using utterances from 107 speakers (46 male, 61 female) from the VCTK dataset . These 107 speakers are partitioned into three speaker-disjoint sets for training, development, and evaluation. The spoofed utterances were generated using four TTS and two VC algorithms in the training and development sets, while 13 TTS/VC algorithms are used in the evaluation set, 4 of which are partially known and 7 of which are unknown for training and development.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the first part of the experiments, we used the end-to-end solution AASIST proposed by Jung et al. (2022) as the baseline model for the pre-training method shown in Figure 1(a). This model uses a novel heterogeneous stacking graph attention layer that models artifacts spanning heterogeneous temporal and spectral domains with a heterogeneous attention mechanism and a stack node. This method achieved the best EER and the lowest t-DCF in the ASVspoof19-LA competition. In contrast, the pre-training method proposed by Tek et al. (2021) uses the pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 XLS-R model as the front-end, replacing the sinc-layer front-end in AASIST. We refer to this method as SSL-AASIST, which obtains the state-of-the-art results reported in the literature for the ASVspoof 2021 LA database. For the pre-training model transfer learning method shown in Figure 1(b), we use the NEMO Conformer-CTC-small-ls model version 1.0.0<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/stt_en_conformer_ctc_small_ls</span></span></span> as the pre-trained CM backend model. This model has the same structure as [24] but replaces the Conformer transducer in [24] with a linear decoder backend and links a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) for decoding. According to the open source code, the convolutional layer of the Conformer-CTC-small-ls model has a downsampling rate of 1/4. The encoder part has 13M parameters with 4 attention heads and 16 Conformer blocks. The feature dimension of the encoder convolutional layer is 176, and the feature dimension of the FFN is 704. The model was trained on the LibriSpeech dataset, which contains around 1000 hours of English speech. [26, 33] We use this non-pre-trained Conformer model as a comparative baseline model.</p>

<div id="S5.SS4.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first verify the robustness and limitations of pre-trained models under noise and reverberation conditions. As shown in Table 6, under the condition of using only the clean training data provided by ASVspoof 2019 LA, the Conformer-based anti-spoofing system with our proposed pre-trained transfer learning method and the front-end based AASIST anti-spoofing system with large-scale pre-trained models demonstrate better noise robustness compared to their respective baseline models. However, under reverberation conditions, the transfer learning scheme shows more significant improvement over the SOTA model’s pre-trained fine-tuning scheme only under low reverberation conditions with RT60 of 0.25s. As the reverberation increases, the transfer learning scheme significantly reduces the reverberation robustness of the anti-spoofing system. This is because the LibriSpeech dataset used for pre-training the Conformer contains no noise or reverberation, whereas the XLSR front-end is pre-trained on a larger dataset that includes more complex data scenarios. This is also reflected in the Music and Environmental Noise test sets, where the performance improvement of the Conformer pre-trained model is less significant than that of the SSL-AASIST scheme. Therefore, although pre-training exposes the model to more diverse data, pre-training alone is not sufficient to provide the model with enough generalization ability to handle various types of disturbances.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Table 6 shows the performance of the three systems used in this study on the noise test set under three training conditions: clean training data from ASVspoof 19 LA, data augmentation, and joint optimization with the speech enhancement front-end. We observe that for the ResNet18 and LCNN anti-spoofing networks without pre-training, noise data augmentation significantly improves model robustness. Further using the front-end speech separation U-net network can further enhance model robustness. However, we find that the proposed joint optimization model of the front-end speech enhancement and pre-trained Conformer shows less robustness improvement in many cases compared to simple data augmentation. On the reverberation test set, as shown in Table 7, we observe similar patterns, and the joint optimization model of the front-end speech enhancement and pre-trained Conformer also shows instability in robustness improvement under reverberation conditions.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We believe this is because the parameters of the Unet speech enhancement front-end are randomly initialized at the beginning of training, leading to poor reconstruction of the input signal’s mel spectrogram by the Unet in the early stages of training. Since the Conformer is pre-trained, the expected input for the Conformer is a speech FBANK feature. The inconsistency between the embedding output by the Unet and the expected input domain of the Conformer increases the difficulty of training. We anticipate solving this issue by using a pre-trained Unet front-end model. As shown in Figure 9, this boxplot illustrates the average performance on various noise and reverberation conditions after jointly optimizing the Unet speech enhancement front-end with different epochs of pre-training with the T. Conformer on the ASVspoof19LA training and development sets. We observe that for Music and Environmental Noise, the average EER of the system decreases with the number of training epochs of the Unet enhancement network. Although the performance of the system on Babble noise and reverberation test data shows a trend with the increase in Unet training epochs, overall, using a pre-trained Unet front-end for joint optimization with the T. Conformer yields better results than directly using an untrained front-end enhancement network for joint optimization. This is because, after a certain number of pre-training epochs, the Unet’s output embedding more closely matches the input feature distribution the T. Conformer is familiar with during training.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Table 9 shows the results of the ablation experiments. When we freeze the parameters of the pre-trained Unet speech enhancement front-end, i.e., without joint training, speech enhancement and synthesized speech detection become independent tasks, which reduces the model’s performance in complex scenarios to some extent. We observe that the proposed model with pre-trained joint optimization of the speech enhancement front-end and the detection back-end shows significant advantages under noise and reverberation conditions. However, for music noise and babble noise at extremely low SNRs of 0dB or 5dB, joint training may lead to slight performance degradation. This is because babble noise consists of real speech recordings, and at extremely low SNRs, overlapping speech segments make it difficult for the model to determine which segment needs to be judged for authenticity. Therefore, all methods perform poorly under extremely low SNR babble noise conditions, lacking comparability. Visualization of the output of the Unet on the fabricated sample LA_E_2178426.wav with 0dB music noise added shows that this is because the music noise presents clear tonal variations in the FBANK, which are distinctly different from the rhythm and pitch variations of speech. This allows the standalone speech enhancement front-end to accurately remove music noise without introducing additional artifacts. Hence, further joint training is unnecessary; an efficient anti-spoofing back-end model can effectively determine the authenticity of the speech. Freezing the Unet in the ResNet18 and LCNN back-end countermeasure models leads to consistent performance degradation across various noise and reverberation conditions.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a method for spoofed speech detection based on transfer learning of an ASR pre-trained Conformer model and joint optimization with a speech enhancement front-end to address the performance degradation of other anti-spoofing systems in noisy and reverberant scenarios. The transfer learning of the Conformer model backend brings more diverse and extensive out-of-domain positive sample data information to the model. The joint optimization of the speech enhancement front-end, based on our previous work, extends the discussion from additive noise to convolutional reverberation. The pre-trained Unet speech enhancement front-end addresses the input domain mismatch with the transfer learning back-end model. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other baseline models in most SNR noise and different reverberation intensity scenarios and demonstrates cross-noise type generalization ability in cross-dataset experiments. However, the proposed method still needs improvement in handling babble noise. In the future, we will focus on addressing the challenge of detecting spoofed speech with real speech disturbances.</p>
