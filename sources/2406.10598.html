<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">As computer-based applications are becoming more integrated into our daily lives, the importance of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has increased significantly.
Promoting research with innovative approaches in SER, the Odyssey 2024 Speech Emotion Recognition Challenge was organized as part of the Odyssey 2024 Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop.
In this paper we describe the Double Multi-Head Attention Multimodal System developed for this challenge.
Pre-trained self-supervised models were used to extract informative acoustic and text features.
An early fusion strategy was adopted, where a Multi-Head Attention layer transforms these mixed features into complementary contextualized representations.
A second attention mechanism is then applied to pool these representations into an utterance-level vector.
Our proposed system achieved the third position in the categorical task ranking with a 34.41% Macro-F1 score, where 31 teams participated in total.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">Natural Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is becoming more and more important as machines and computer-based applications are gaining significance in our daily lives </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.p1.1.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a><span id="S1.p1.1.3.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.
A key step in HCI is to recognize and address people’s emotional states.
In addition, automatic emotion detection and classification are essential for automated tutoring systems, call centers, gaming, personal assistants and more.
For these reasons, progress in these technologies can enable transformative applications in diverse areas such as healthcare, security and defense, education and entertainment.
Humans use various modalities to express their emotions, such as speech, text, facial expressions or gestures.
Because of the subtle expressive behaviors that arise during human interactions, automatic emotion recognition from speech in realistic domains is still a challenging task </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.p1.1.5.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a><span id="S1.p1.1.6.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">Speech is essential for expressing a person’s emotional state through prosody and/or paralinguistic context.
In the domain of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), Machine Learning (ML) models have been constructed relying on the utilization of hand-crafted features, such as Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), pitch, energy, entropy or zero-crossing rate </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.p2.1.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a><span id="S1.p2.1.3.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.
The correlation between different emotions and specific speech features is still uncertain, and ongoing research is being conducted to investigate specific speech representations that can effectively capture human emotions’ patterns.
However, deep learning-based models do not require the extraction of a large set of hand-crafted features because they can learn the features that are relevant to the task from spectrograms or even directly from raw waveforms. Nevertheless, a large amount of training data is needed to construct these complex systems because a lack of it could result in poor generalization performance on unseen data conditions.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">Emotions can also be captured using text information.
Several techniques have been developed to represent and model this type of data.
In many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, word and sentence embeddings (such as Word2Vec </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.p3.1.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a><span id="S1.p3.1.3.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;"> or BERT-based </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.p3.1.5.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a><span id="S1.p3.1.6.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S1.p3.1.7" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">) have proven to be the most efficient representations, yielding significant improvements in deep learning models performance.
Despite offering an enhanced representation of textual information, these techniques have certain limitations when applying them effectively to different tasks.
One of the principal difficulties is that training these models requires huge amounts of data and computational power.</span></p>

The challenge consists of two independent tasks allowing to compare different emotion recognition systems submitted by teams all around the world.
The first task objective is to classify speech segments across the eight categorical emotional classes provided: anger, happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, contempt, disgust and a neutral state.
The second task consists of predicting emotional attributes for arousal (calm to active), valence (negative to positive), and dominance (weak to strong).
The challenge uses recordings from the MSP-Podcast corpus, which contains speech segments obtained from audio-sharing websites </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.p4.1.5.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a><span id="S1.p4.1.6.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S1.p4.1.7" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.</span></p>

In this system, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encodes short-term speaker features from the spectrogram, which are split into homogeneous sub-vectors.
Each self-attention pooling head is applied over a split of sub-vectors.
This mechanism allows the model to attend to the most informative patterns from different positions of the encoded sequence.
In a later work </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.p5.1.5.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a><span id="S1.p5.1.6.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S1.p5.1.7" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">, the authors present the Double Multi-Head Attention (DMHA), where a second self-attention pooling is applied.
This additional pooling layer allows the model to select which head context vectors are the most relevant to produce an enhanced utterance-level vector.
Since this network is trained as a speaker classifier, it can be easily adapted to solve Speaker Classification tasks such as SER </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.p5.1.8.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a><span id="S1.p5.1.9.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S1.p5.1.10" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.</span></p>

We used this architecture for the Odyssey 2024 Speech Emotion Recognition Challenge categorical recognition task.
Since self-supervised pre-trained models learn universal representations from massive unlabeled speech data and adapt effectively across various downstream tasks, several pre-trained versions of these architectures were explored to extract acoustic features.
Additionally, speech utterances were automatically transcribed with Whisper </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.p6.1.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a><span id="S1.p6.1.3.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S1.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;"> and then text features were extracted using a pre-trained BERT </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.p6.1.5.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a><span id="S1.p6.1.6.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S1.p6.1.7" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;"> model.
A Multi-Head Attention layer is used to transform these speech and text features into contextualized representations.
Using this attention technique allows the model to learn complex relationships between acoustic and linguistic information.
These contextualized representations are then pooled into an utterance-level vector using a second attention mechanism.
Finally, we used a set of fully connected layers to classify the corresponding emotions.
Models were trained by applying an on-line data augmentation process.
Three different models were used in a hard-voting ensemble to achieve the third position in the Task 1 Challenge ranking, where 31 teams participated in total.</span></p>

Commonly, a SER system includes a feature extraction component and a pooling layer that aggregates the extracted features into a single utterance-level vector.
Finally, a classification layer takes the pooled vector as input and outputs each emotion probability.
Nevertheless, the automatic recognition of emotions from speech in realistic domains remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the intricate nature of expressive behaviors that manifest during human interactions.</span></p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">One major obstacle in SER is still the lack of substantial amounts of labelled data needed to construct complex enough deep learning models </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S2.p2.1.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a><span id="S2.p2.1.3.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.
To address this problem, several data augmentation methods were developed to generate synthetic data </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S2.p2.1.5.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a><span id="S2.p2.1.6.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S2.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.
Additionally, unsupervised or self-supervised pre-training of neural networks emerged as an effective technique for settings where labelled data is scarce.
The key idea is to learn general representations in a setup where substantial amounts of data are available.
These learned representations are then used to improve performance on a downstream task for which the amount of data is limited.
This is particularly interesting for tasks like SER, where a substantial effort to obtain labelled data is required.</span></p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">SER systems take audio signals as input.
In order to improve the performance of these systems, a feature extraction process is usually applied.
In this process, features are extracted from the audio signal by changing the speech waveform to a form of parametric representation.
Several options are available to parametrically represent the speech signal for the recognition process.
The Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) feature extraction strategy is recognized as one of the most effective and universally adopted techniques in the speech recognition domain </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S2.p3.1.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a><span id="S2.p3.1.3.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.

Some inputs are simulated noisy/overlapped speech with masks and the target is to predict the pseudo-label of the original speech on the masked region like HuBERT.
By doing this, wavLM learns universal speech representations from massive unlabeled speech data and adapts effectively across various speech processing tasks.</span></p>

Within the statistical pooling strategies, the most commonly used are average pooling and statistical pooling </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S2.p6.1.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a><span id="S2.p6.1.3.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S2.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.
These strategies assume that all elements of the pooling component input vectors contribute equally to the utterance-level vector creation.
Since every frame may not provide equal speech discriminative information, many works applied self-attention mechanisms for weighted learning-based pooling layers.
Single-head attention pooling with different self-attentive scoring functions was explored in </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S2.p6.1.5.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a><span id="S2.p6.1.6.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S2.p6.1.7" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.
Also, multi-head attention pooling approaches were applied successfully in several works </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S2.p6.1.8.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a><span id="S2.p6.1.9.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S2.p6.1.10" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.
Because pooling layers behave differently with different datasets, network structures or loss functions, it is difficult to conclude which one is the best, if there is one.
Pooling functions with learnable parameters achieved better results than the simple pooling layers such as the average pooling and statistical pooling in most cases, with a weakness of higher computational complexity than the latter.</span></p>

The expressiveness of unimodal information is naturally restricted, so it frequently fails to fully convey the wide range of human emotions.
Since spoken data consists of audio and text information, studies have explored the combination of acoustic features and linguistic content for emotion recognition.
The fusion of diverse types of signals to obtain complementary information is key to improving model performance in MER.
These approaches implement this combination by mixing either each modality embeddings (known as early fusion) or decision scores (late fusion) </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S2.p7.1.5.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a><span id="S2.p7.1.6.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">]</span></cite><span id="S2.p7.1.7" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.</span></p>

Whisper is an Automatic Speech Recognition Transformer-based system trained with up to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask data.
When compared to humans, this model approaches their accuracy and robustness.
A pre-trained BERT model was used to extract text features from the transcriptions.
The BERT large uncased pre-trained version was used, which was trained on lower-cased English text.
This version has a total of 340M parameters, using 24 Transformer layers to output 1024-dimensional text representations.

Every model was trained for 20 epochs, using early stopping to avoid overfitting.
All our models were trained and evaluated using 2 GPUs (NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X, NVIDIA TITAN Xp or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti).

The Focal Loss function is a dynamically scaled cross-entropy loss, where the scaling factor decays to zero as confidence in the correct class increases.
Intuitively, this scaling factor can automatically down-weight the contribution of easy examples during training and rapidly focus the model on hard examples.
This scaling factor is governed by a parameter gamma, which was set to </span><math id="S5.SS2.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p4.1.m1.1a"><mn mathsize="90%" id="S5.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">2</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p4.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1">2</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p4.1.m1.1c">2</annotation></semantics></math><span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.</span></p>

The idea is to adjust each class decision threshold to improve their precision and recall.
For each class, we convert the task to a binary classification by treating the rest as a whole one negative class.
Then, different thresholds were explored to maximize the training Macro F1-score.
Once every threshold is set, the way of predicting the final class is the following: if the class with the highest probability output surpass its corresponding threshold, then that class is predicted (no change is done).
If the class with the highest probability output do not surpass its corresponding threshold, then the class with the next highest probability is predicted.</span></p>

The motivation for using ensemble models is to reduce the generalization error of the final prediction.

A hard voting strategy was adopted for the ensemble.
In case of a tie, we used the prediction of a predefined model (the one with the best validation Macro F1-score).</span></p>

A model ensemble using the following three configurations was also evaluated: WCE loss and XLS-R speech features extractor; WCE loss and wav2vec2.0 speech features extractor; WCE loss and wavLM speech features extractor.
The choice of these three models was motivated by the idea that extracting different patterns from the same speech utterance may contribute to the final system diversity.
After applying threshold adjustment, we evaluate them using Macro F1-score both in the training and validation datasets of the competition.
Applying threshold adjustment increased validation Macro F1-score approximately in a 1% absolute both for the Standard and the sub-vector-based models, being a useful strategy for this competition.</span></p>

We can see that the system achieves the best results detecting happiness and anger.
There are some emotions that may be more similar and the model can confuse: when the real emotion is contempt, it predicts anger 30% of the time; a similar situation arises for surprise and happiness; disgust is predicted as anger or contempt around 45% of the cases.
Finally, fear is the worst performance class.</span></p>

To that end, each head attention weights of a particular audio sample were calculated.
For each head, every contextual representation uses learned attention weights (matrix rows) to attend to each of the speech and text features (matrix columns), as visualized in figures </span><a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.3 Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Double Multi-Head Attention Multimodal System for Odyssey 2024 Speech Emotion Recognition Challenge" class="ltx_ref" style="font-size:90%;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a><span id="S5.SS3.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;"> and </span><a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.3 Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Double Multi-Head Attention Multimodal System for Odyssey 2024 Speech Emotion Recognition Challenge" class="ltx_ref" style="font-size:90%;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a><span id="S5.SS3.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.

Given that both the configurations with WCE Loss and HuBERT speech feature extractor and with Focal Loss and XLS-R speech feature extractor surpass the baseline validation score, we conclude that combining a powerful self-supervised feature extractor with a sub-vector-based Double Multi-Head Attention Multimodal Fusion component can obtain good results for this task.
Since the sub-vector MHA has significantly less parameters than the standard MHA, this efficient architecture could be useful in settings where large models are not allowed and/or training data is scarce, which is a common scenario in SER.</span></p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">In this paper we have described our Double Multi-Head Attention Multimodal System for the Odyssey 2024 Speech Emotion Recognition Challenge.
Acoustic and text features were extracted using pre-trained self-supervised models.
These multimodal features are mixed adopting an early fusion strategy.
First, an MHA layer generates complementary contextualized representations.
A second attention layer is then applied to pool these representations into an utterance-level vector.
For the first attention layer, we experimented with different mechanisms: standard MHA and sub-vector MHA.
Since the sub-vector variant has significantly less parameters than the standard one, our obtained results show that this efficient architecture could be useful in settings where large models are not allowed and/or training data is scarce.
On the other hand, applying standard MHA allows the model to capture complex relationships jointly attending to information from different representation subspaces.
In terms of relative improvement, our best model gained 10.1% validation Macro F1-score compared to the baseline.
This model outperforms the challenge official baseline with a 3.1% absolute increase in the validation Macro F1-score, achieving the third position in the categorical task ranking, where 31 teams participated in total.</span></p>
