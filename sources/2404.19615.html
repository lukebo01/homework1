<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, Event Sound Source Localization has been widely applied in various fields. Recent works typically relying on the contrastive learning framework show impressive performance. However, all work is based on large relatively simple datasets. It’s also crucial to understand and analyze human behaviors (actions and interactions of people), voices and sounds in chaotic events in many applications, e.g., crowd management, and emergency response services. In this paper, we apply the existing model to a more complex dataset, explore the influence of parameters on the model, and propose a semi-supervised improvement method SemiPL. With the increase in data quantity and the influence of label quality, self-supervised learning will be an unstoppable trend. The experiment shows that the parameter adjustment will positively affect the existing model. In particular, SSPL achieved an improvement of 12.2% cIoU and 0.56% AUC in Chaotic World compared to the results provided. The code is available at:

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Vision can influence our perception of sound. For example, when we view a picture, visual images can change our interpretation and emotional experience of the sound. Visual images, colors, and motion can guide our perception of sound and the construction of scenarios. Hearing can also influence our perception and experience of visuals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. For example, when we hear a sound, the pitch, volume, and rhythm of the sound can influence our perception and emotion of visual objects. Sound can enhance or diminish our attention, emotions, and feelings about our visual environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">When we hear the roar of a car engine, we can infer the speed and motion of the car based on the pitch and volume of the engine sound. Early experiments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> have shown that sudden sounds enhance perceptual processing of subsequent visual stimuli. This sound perception of speed directly affects our visual perception of the road and vehicles around us. This interplay and interaction stems from the brain’s ability to synthesize and process different sensations. By integrating existing sensory inputs, the brain develops a more comprehensive and accurate perceptual experience. This interaction also reflects the connections and coordination between perceptions, helping us to better understand and adapt to our surroundings.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, acoustic event detection is a rather broad topic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> in the field of environmental sound detection and classification, with a wide range of applicability in surveillance and monitoring, assistive technologies, and multimedia indexing. Recent works showing impressive localization performance typically rely on the contrastive learning framework. With the increase in data quantity and the influence of label quality, self-supervised learning will be an unstoppable trend in the future <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. For datasets with partial labels, undoubtedly, semi-supervised learning is the best choice and also the inevitable trend for the future development of sound source localization. So, we propose a semi-supervised method SemiPL.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Sound source localization within visual scenes seeks to pinpoint the location of objects producing sound within a specified image. Initial efforts to address this challenging task predominantly focused on leveraging statistical modeling of crossmodal relationships, utilizing techniques such as mutual information and canonical correlation analysis to effectively capture the underlying associations. Nonetheless, these shallow models primarily demonstrate their strengths in relatively straightforward audio-visual scenarios. Currently, employing deep learning techniques to tackle this task has become the mainstream approach. For example, Senocak et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> introduce an innovative unsupervised algorithm for localizing sound sources by utilizing an attention mechanism. This mechanism is guided by auditory information in conjunction with paired sound and video frames, offering a sophisticated approach to address the problem. In response to the daunting challenge of visually localizing multiple sound sources in unconstrained videos without the availability of pairwise sound-object annotations, Qian et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> engineered a two-stage audiovisual learning framework. This innovative solution separates audio and visual representations of different categories within complex scenes and subsequently executes a cross-modal feature alignment in a progressively refined manner.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Self-supervised learning (SSL) has made significant strides and achieved remarkable breakthroughs in large-scale computer vision benchmarks. The majority of contemporary SSL methods rely on the implementation of contrastive learning strategies. Fundamentally, these approaches transform a single image into multiple views, simultaneously repelling distinct images (negatives) while attracting various perspectives of the same image (positives). Numerous efforts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> have been dedicated to alleviating the reliance on negatives and streamlining the SSL framework beyond the scope of traditional contrastive learning approaches. For instance, to minimize the computational burden associated with positive and negative sample pairs, Ermolov et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> chart a different course by proposing a novel loss function for SSL, which is founded on the whitening of latent-space features. Grill et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> presents a fresh approach to self-supervised image representation learning, known as Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL). This innovative method hinges on the synergy between two neural networks, dubbed online and target networks, which collaborate and continuously learn from one another.</p>

For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, visual features drawn from a pre-trained teacher network assist a student network in acquiring more distinctive audio representations, and the reverse is also true <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Korbar et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and Owens and Efros [41] leveraged the synchronization between audio and visual streams to create negative samples and formulate contrast loss, respectively, aiming to derive generalized multisensory characteristics. Certain investigations have also delved into audio-visual correspondences via feature clustering. Primarily, these methodologies concentrate on acquiring task-independent representations for downstream classification-related endeavors, including action/scene recognition, audio event categorization, and video retrieval. Nevertheless, as they are not tailored for sound source localization, their performance on this particular task remains constrained.</p>

It is hypothesized that because most of the occurring objects in the dataset are people, the model did not learn the vocal characteristics of the rest of the vocal objects (e.g., drums) very well. The semi-supervised model may have been disturbed by the data where some of the vocalized objects were not people, and the training effect was instead reduced.</p>

Decreasing the learning rate appears to mitigate the fluctuations in accuracy throughout the training epochs. However, this seemingly beneficial effect comes at a cost: a significant reduction in the convergence speed of the model. In practical terms, this slowdown in convergence renders the training process prohibitively slow, thereby undermining the overall efficacy of the learning algorithm. Consequently, striking a balance between stability and speed becomes paramount in optimizing the learning rate for the given task or model architecture.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The performance of our SemiPL, while promising, is not quite on par with that of self-supervised models. One potential reason for this could be the relatively large bounding box range used during training. This extensive range may have interfered with the model’s ability to learn precise localization, as it introduced too much noise and irrelevant information into the learning process. This hypothesis suggests that refining the bounding box or exploring new data annotation strategies may improve the performance of semi-supervised learning models. Future research in this area is expected to provide valuable insights and advances in the overall development of semi-supervised learning.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we implemented the Self-Supervised Predictive Learning method (SSPL) and our novel Semi-supervised Predictive Learning approach, SemiPL, on the Chaotic World dataset. Our primary objective was to elevate the accuracy of visual-audio localization by explicitly mining positive correspondences. To achieve this, we utilized a tri-stream network coupled with a strategic training regimen to establish the relationship between audio signals and their corresponding video frames within the same video clip. Although SSPL proved effective in single-source audio localization tasks, it fell short in multi-source scenarios primarily due to the limited size of the dataset. Despite this limitation, the expanding availability of data and the escalating importance of label quality indicate that self-supervised learning is destined to become a prevailing trend in machine learning. A potential solution is to develop a fully supervised approach to multi-source localization tasks, which we leave for future work.</p>
