<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have sparked performance boosts in various real-world applications including disease diagnosis based on multi-modal medical data. Cough sound data-based respiratory disease (e.g., COVID-19 and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) diagnosis has also attracted much attention. However, existing works usually utilise traditional machine learning or deep models of moderate scales. On the other hand, the developed approaches are trained and evaluated on small-scale data due to the difficulty of curating and annotating clinical data on scale. To address these issues in prior works, we create a unified framework to evaluate various deep models from lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (e.g., ResNet18) to modern vision transformers and compare their performance in respiratory disease classification. Based on the observations from such an extensive empirical study, we propose a novel algorithm <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Cough Search</span> for cough-based disease classification based on both self-supervised and supervised learning on a large-scale cough data set. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed approach outperforms prior arts consistently on two benchmark datasets for COVID-19 diagnosis and a proprietary dataset for COPD/non-COPD classification with an AUROC of 92.5%.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 and COPD are widespread in populations and early diagnosis is imperative for disease control and human well-being. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, COPD was the third fatal disease in the world in 2022 and is expected to remain the third
cause of death through 2050 at the global level. The current diagnosis of COPD requires measurements of lung functions using clinical equipment in hospitals which is expensive and inconvenient for mass screening. As a result, a significant fraction of COPD patients are undiagnosed in China and are exposed to risks of developing into fatal cancers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The advancement of machine learning and deep learning techniques enables digital diagnosis for various diseases with satisfying accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. These data-driven techniques can discover hidden patterns in patient’s medical data and connect them with disease labels of interest. In general, machines are expected to understand medical data at an equivalent level as experts for disease diagnosis after being exposed to large-scale high-quality data for training.
Nowadays, various medical data modalities have been investigated for disease diagnosis. Comprehensive surveys have been made for deep learning techniques used in medical applications using medical imagery <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, physiological data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, electronic health records <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and audio data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Among many respiratory sounds such as wheezing, crackles, and breathing, cough sounds have been used to diagnose respiratory diseases in a long history as cough sounds contain indicative patterns closely related to pathomorphological alterations in the respiratory system. Researchers have tried to develop various digital methods for cough sound-based respiratory disease diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, most existing studies use traditional machine learning methods and handcrafted features extracted by classic audio signal processing techniques or relatively lightweight deep models. This is mainly caused by the lack of large-scale cough data sets to pre-train or even fine-tune modern deep models like wav2vec <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. For the same reason, the performance reported on small datasets may be biased and unreliable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> released a series of respiratory acoustic foundation models which are based on the latest self-supervised learning and are pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled respiratory sound data. In addition, the pre-trained foundation models are evaluated on a curated list of downstream tasks for respiratory sound classification or regression. The benchmarking in this work compares several modern deep models originally designed for audio event classification and demonstrates the superiority of their proposed models which are pre-trained specifically on respiratory sound data. However, their released models are based on backbone models of moderate sizes compared with the most advanced ones for audio event or image classification.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we focus on cough sound data and investigate the best practices for improving the accuracy of cough-based respiratory disease diagnosis. Motivated by existing works in general audio and image classification, we raise the following research questions in this study:
(1) Which pre-trained models are most appropriate for cough-based respiratory disease classification in terms of accuracy and efficiency?
(2) What are the best practices for fine-tuning a pre-trained model for enhanced cough-based respiratory disease classification?
(3) What are the best practices of model ensemble and selection for optimal classification performance?</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Audio event classification is a well-formulated research task that has attracted significant attention in the community. Deep learning models have dominated state-of-the-art approaches to this task in recent years. These approaches follow a similar framework in which the raw audio data are converted to log-mel-spectrogram images. Hence, innovations in image classification models can also benefit the audio event classification tasks by proper transfer learning. Such transfer learning is enabled by fine-tuning the pre-trained image classification models on large-scale audio datasets like AudioSet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">According to the model architectures, existing approaches to audio event classification in the literature can be categorized into two groups: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Whilst early works employing ImageNet-pretrained CNN models on audio spectrograms achieved competitive accuracy, they have been outperformed by transformer-based models. Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> was one of the first to apply vision transformers to audio event classification and performed superior to their CNN counterparts. Koutini et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed the PaSST series by evaluating different variants of tailored ViT models and efficient training strategies for audio event classification. These works vary from one another in their employed backbone architectures and audio data preprocessing but share a similar transfer learning framework in which the ImageNet-pre-trained models are fine-tuned on audio spectrogram data for downstream tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With access to large-scale audio datasets like AudioSet-2M, more recent works turn to self-supervised learning for enhanced audio representation learning. A framework consisting of self-supervised learning and supervised fine-tuning has been employed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and leads to state-of-the-art methods for audio event classification in various downstream tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The aforementioned models are usually evaluated on several benchmark datasets for audio event classification. Those performing well in general audio classification tasks are expected to perform well in a specific downstream task like cough sound classification. We believe a thorough evaluation is imperative for choosing the most appropriate solutions to the specific cough sound classification task in practice. More recently, Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> made a thorough evaluation of self-supervised learning models across several respiratory sound classification tasks, however, their work aims at a wider scope than cough data classification and their released models were only pre-trained on respiratory sound data which lead to sub-optimal performance as observed in our comparative study.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Cough sound-based respiratory disease classification has attracted much attention. Researchers have explored the possibility and efficacy of using cough data to diagnose various respiratory diseases including tuberculosis (TB) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, Asthma <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, pneumonic infections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and COVID-19 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, most of these prior works use traditional machine learning approaches such as logistic regression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, support vector machine <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, tree-based models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, multi-layer perceptrons <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> and classical convolutional neural networks like ResNet50 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. The evaluations were usually made on small private datasets, preventing a direct fair comparison across different works and making the practical use of proposed methods difficult.
For example, Pahar et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> evaluated various traditional machine learning methods for cough-based TB classification and the best logistic regression achieves an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.94 using 23 features selected from a set of 78 high-resolution mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. Later, the same group employed the Resnet50 classifier, and discriminated between the COVID-19 positive and the healthy coughs with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.98 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">

Attempts have also been made using modern deep-learning models for cough classification. Approaches falling into this category preprocess the raw audio data into log-mel spectrogram image data so that they can be fed into deep models originally designed for image classification. Xue et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> propose a novel self-supervised learning framework for COVID-19 cough classification. A vision transformer (ViT) is firstly trained on unlabeled cough data in a self-supervised learning manner and the pre-trained model is subsequently fine-tuned on the downstream classification task for COVID-19 screening. Valdes et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> also employ a ViT-based model Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> for cough signal feature extraction towards the classification cough types (e.g., dry, wet, whooping, etc.). The employed AST was pre-trained on a large-scale image dataset ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> and a large-scale audio dataset AudioSet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> subsequently. However, features extracted from the pre-trained models are directly used in the downstream task. We believe the data distribution gap between general audio data (e.g., those in AudioSet) and cough data will restrict the capabilities of deep models without proper transfer learning. To address this limitation, in this study, we further fine-tune the ViT-based deep models on cough data to enhance their representation learning from cough data to discover disease signatures underlying cough sound data.</p>

However, it is unclear if such a layer can still benefit ViT-based models when they are pre-trained and fine-tuned on large-scale audio datasets (e.g., AudioSet).</p>

In the first phase, a rapid burst of air breaks through the glottis. In the second phase, the glottis is fully open, allowing air to be steadily expelled from the lungs. Finally, there is possibly a phase where the airflow decreases as the glottis gradually closes.</p>

Initially, the audio signal undergoes a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with a hop length of 0.016 seconds and a window length of 0.021 seconds, utilizing the Hanning window function. Subsequently, the magnitude spectrum is derived by taking the absolute value of the STFT coefficients. Next, the magnitude spectrum is integrated across the 120Hz-8000Hz frequency band to yield a univariate energy sequence. The ratio of the current frame’s energy to that of the preceding frame is computed, and its logarithm is taken to generate a sequence representing the rate of energy change. This sequence is then smoothed using a Butterworth low-pass filter. Peaks in the energy change rate are identified by applying a threshold of 100 to this sequence. For each detected peak in energy change rate, the corresponding energy peak is located within a window of 5 frames centred on the peak. Ultimately, the cough onset is identified as occurring two frames before the located energy peak positions.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the deep learning era, a common practice is to use a pre-trained deep model and fine-tune it on the downstream task. It is crucial to choose an appropriate pre-trained model for good performance in the downstream tasks. For cough sound spectrogram-based disease classification problems, the candidate pre-trained models can be categorised into three groups according to the pre-training data modalities. In this study, three types of pre-trained models are considered: ImageNet-pre-trained models, audio data pre-trained models and respiratory sound data pre-trained models</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">ImageNet-pre-trained models have been widely used in a variety of computer vision tasks due to the fact they are extensively studied, rapidly evolved and easily accessible.

As ImageNet-pre-trained models require 3-channel images as inputs, we duplicate the generated 1-channel spectrogram three times to form 3-channel images.

<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Audio data pre-trained models close the gap between natural images and audio spectrogram images by pre-training deep neural networks on large-scale audio data. During pre-training, the models take audio spectrogram images as the input and hence can be directly applied to downstream tasks for respiratory sound classification. As the pre-trained models may have employed different parameters to generate the spectrogram, the same process for spectrogram generation as that used during pre-training must be employed during fine-tuning.</p>

It is common to have unbalanced data in medical applications where positive samples (with diseases) are far less than negative ones (healthy). To combat such an issue, we use a simple yet effective strategy which assigns label-dependent weights when computing the loss. The loss for samples belonging to the lower-represented class (positive) is multiplied by a higher weight. The weight can be calculated as the ratio between negative and positive samples in the training set.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Adapting pre-trained foundation models to a specific downstream task suffers from out-of-distribution issues when the supervised training data are limited. In such cases, self-supervised training on large-scale unlabeled data before the supervised training can bridge the data distribution gap between those used in pre-training and fine-tuning. In our targeted use cases, the models pre-trained either on ImageNet or AudioSet may suffer the out-of-distribution issue when applied to the cough data. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by the distribution gap, we use a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline (c.f.

The teacher and the student models share the same architecture of a vision transformer. The student model weights are updated normally by gradient descent whilst the teach model weights are updated by the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) strategy. The objective of training the student model is composed of a global loss and a local loss. Both are implemented by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. The global loss aims to align the final representations output by the student and teacher models.</p>

Specifically, the negative samples in our dataset include those collected from patients diagnosed with asthma, upper/lower respiratory tract infection (URI/LRI), Bronchiectasis and other non-COPD respiratory diseases. The LucaCough dataset consists of cough data from 3000 subjects (272 COPD and 2728 non-COPD subjects) in the training subset and cough data from 651 subjects (66 COPD and 586 non-COPD) in the test set. The cough sounds are recorded via several different mobile phones to make the data more diverse and enable the generalisation capabilities of the developed models. The data are manually annotated by at least three clinical experts with the help of medical records and lung function test readings. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants.

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we evaluate the performance of models pre-trained on audio data (e.g., AudioSet-2M). Specifically, we evaluate PaSST-S <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, EAT-base and EAT-large <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> on the benchmark datasets. PaSST-S is based on DeiT-B384 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> which has the same architecture as ViT-B <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. EAT-base is based on ViT-B hence both PaSST-S and EAT-base have 86M parameters, 12 Multi-head self-attention (MSA) layers, 12 attention heads and the embedding dimension is 768. EAT-large is based on ViT-L and has 307M parameters, 24 MSA layers, 16 attention heads and the embedding dimension is 1024.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We use the code and checkpoints released by the authors of these two works and follow their instructions for fine-tuning on the three downstream tasks. All the checkpoints utilised in our experiments were trained on the large-scale AudioSet-2M dataset in a supervised learning way. In addition, the EAT models were also pre-trained on the AudioSet-2M dataset using a self-supervised learning strategy before fine-tuning on the same dataset. To further fine-tune the models on our downstream tasks, the classification head is replaced with a linear layer with two output neurons for the binary classification problems.</p>

The investigated models perform comparably well on three downstream tasks. On the COUGHVID dataset, EAT-large achieves higher AUROC than the lighter version EAT-base which again outperforms PaSST-S. However, compared with the experimental results shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ Towards Reliable Respiratory Disease Diagnosis Based on Cough Sounds and Vision Transformers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, all three audio data pre-trained models perform significantly better than most of the ImageNet-pre-trained ones on three downstream tasks consistently.

<div id="S4.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct experiments to evaluate models pre-trained on respiratory sound data. The models employed in these experiments include those released by Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and EAT models further trained on cough data by ourselves. Firstly, we apply the released pre-trained models to the LucaCough datasets and present the experimental results together with those from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> on the other two datasets. Subsequently, we continue the pertaining of EAT models on a large-scale cough sound dataset. As a result, we have a variant of the pre-trained EAT-large model dubbed <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Cough Search</span> as it was further trained on cough data. The <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Cough Search</span> model is subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks to obtain the classification results and compare them with other respiratory sound data pre-trained models (i.e. the OPERA series). To make a fair comparison, we use the official code released by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> to fine-tune the OPERA models on downstream tasks whilst only linear probing results were reported in the original paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The comparison results are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-D Evaluation of AudioSet pre-trained models ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ Towards Reliable Respiratory Disease Diagnosis Based on Cough Sounds and Vision Transformers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> from which several conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, <span id="S4.SS5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Cough Search</span> performs the best on three tasks consistently. Particularly, it outperforms EAT-large on three tasks with the AUROC margins ranging from 0.9 to 3.3 percentage points. This proves that continuous pre-training of the model on cough data can further strengthen its capabilities of classifying diseases based on cough sound data. Secondly, the OPERA models, though pre-trained on respiratory sound data in a self-supervised learning manner, perform inferior not only to <span id="S4.SS5.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Cough Search</span> but also to the models pre-trained on general audio data (i.e. PaSST-S, EAT-base and EAT-large). This may be attributed to the fact of low model capacities or the lack of pre-training on large-scale audio data like AudioSet-2M.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of various deep learning models and their performance in classifying respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) using cough sound data. Our proposed approach, which leverages both self-supervised and supervised learning on a large-scale cough dataset, has demonstrated superior performance on three datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The use of pre-trained models, particularly those pre-trained on respiratory sound data, has shown significant benefits in enhancing the classification of cough sounds. The continuous pre-training of models on cough data, as evidenced by the performance of the <span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Cough Search</span> model, further strengthens the model’s ability to discern disease signatures from cough sound data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While our approach has shown promising results, there is room for further improvement and exploration. Future work could involve the integration of additional data modalities, such as clinical and demographic information, to enhance the predictive power of the models. The development of more sophisticated self-supervised learning techniques tailored to the unique characteristics of cough sounds could potentially uncover more nuanced patterns in the data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, our study represents a significant step towards reliable and accurate respiratory disease diagnosis using cough sounds. The insights gained from this research have the potential to inform the design of future diagnostic systems, ultimately contributing to improved disease control and human well-being.</p>
