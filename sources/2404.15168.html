<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">Voice-based applications are ruling over the era of automation because speech has a lot of factors that determine a speaker’s information as well as speech. Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a blessing in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for efficient communication among humans and devices using Artificial Intelligence technology. Speech is one of the easiest mediums of communication because it has a lot of identical features for different speakers. Nowadays it is possible to determine speakers and their identity using their speech in terms of speaker’s recognition. In this paper, we presented a method that will provide a speaker’s geographical identity in a certain region using continuous Bengali speech. We consider eight different divisions of Bangladesh as the geographical region. We applied the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) and Delta features on an Artificial Neural Network to classify speakers’s division. We performed some preprocessing tasks like noise reduction and 8-10 second segmentation of raw audio before feature extraction. We used our dataset of more than 45 hours of audio data from 633 individual male and female speakers. We recorded the highest accuracy of 85.44%.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Speech is a powerful medium for efficient communication. Having a bunch of unique features like Qualities, Pitch, Tone, Rhythm, Resonance, Texture, and others, speech is one of the most useful identifiers to recognize speakers. To differentiate speakers from the same language and different places speech features work as a powerful attribute and they work as a unique way of introducing a group of people who speak the same language. People from a geographical area or a community have some unique speech properties like they speak in a specific accent and rhythm. Voice also can be the recognition apparatus of Gender, Occupation, Height, Age, Division, Weight, or any other identical parameter of a speaker.

</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For having perfectly structured multiple-level regularized properties speech can produce the basic unit of speech which is defined as phonemes. It can determine the speech clearly and perfectly but for our contribution, speech features define the nature of speech. By which the identification or characteristic of a specific speaker could be possible easily. MFCC provides the necessary feature to train our model so that the model can determine an unknown speaker’s division. Accents could play an important role in determining people from specific geographical areas. Accent-based speaker recognition is one of the emerging topics for ASR researchers. Deep learning algorithms like RNN, ANN, CNN, and LSTM are performing better for speech recognition because of their perfectly structured data. For our data, ANN performs best with the system and configuration we used.

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Region or Division recognition is one of the important tasks of classifying people from a specific geographical area. For our contribution, we consider eight divisions of Bangladesh named Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet as eight labels for speakers Division recognition. The division recognition approach has a lot of applications including the detection of the speaker’s geographical region, verifying the area of unknown crime suspects, and speaker recognition. Nowadays a lot of harassment and crime has been performed using the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). From the perspective of Bangladesh, a huge number of fraud calls and voice threads are performed every year.

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this research, we proposed a deep learning model using the Artificial Neural Network to recognize Bangladeshi speaker’s division from continuous Bengali Speech. Which will help to recognize the unknown speaker’s division in terms of crime suspect and voice fraud. It will also contribute to the Bangla Natural Language Processing and Bangla Automatic Speech Recognition community.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology is improving rapidly only for the huge number of research and development. Researchers are working on ASR technology and their implementation in real life as a huge amount of speech data is produced every day but it is not possible to store and use all this data. Biomechanics technology and applied linguistics are the most commonly used in early ASR technology. However, the modern ASR is improving because of the variety of attributes that vary speaker by speaker. Different factors that affect human speaker recognition application are described by Amino et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In terms of detecting unknown speakers a self-learning speech-controlled system for speaker identification and adaptation using an Unsupervised Speech Controlled System is performed by Herbig et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> -<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. There are also a lot of speech-based speakers’ gender, height, weight, and age detection approaches done by different researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> -<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.

</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Region or Division detection is one of the important tasks of classifying people from a specific geographical area. We found some work related to speaker’s region detection using their voice. The most similar work is done by M. F. Hossain et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> where they tried to recognize speakers from different regions of the United Kingdom using voice based on Accent classification. They used a traditional Machine Learning algorithm on speech features extracted by MFCC and showed a maximum accuracy of 99% with k-NN on Crowdsourced high-quality UK and Ireland English Dialect speech datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Different accent detection is done by Joseph et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> for four Indian languages Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Marathi. They performed the region detection approach from different languages spoken in India based on their accent using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm which shows an impressive result. For the Tagalog language in the Philippines, Danao et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> perform a regional accent detection approach with an accuracy of 93.33% using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier.

</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning is widely used in the field of ASR as the speech is the continuous waveform of an audio signal. So sequential models like LSTM, RNN, and ANN work better for speech signals. An overview of using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approaches used in speech recognition is reviewed by Hennebert et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> where some basic principles of neural networks are briefly described as well as their current applications and performances in speech recognition. In most cases, MFCC performs better than any other feature extraction algorithm in the field of ASR research. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the voice-based region recognition applications work on Accent. We also found some accent-based voice recognition applications. We found that Mannepalli et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> introduced a method to identify three different accents namely Coastal Andhra, Rayalaseema, and Telangana of the Telugu language using the Nearest Neighbor Classifier and achieved 72% accuracy. For Chinese accent detection, Long et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> perform a method based on RASTA – PLP algorithm extracting features known as the short-time spectrum of each speech segment and records an accuracy of 80.8% using Naïve Bayes classifier. Zheng et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> propose a new combination of accent discriminative acoustic features, accent detection, and an acoustic adaptation approach for accented Chinese speech recognition. We don’t find any related papers for the Bangla Language.

A huge number of experiments and developments have been made and as a result, different implementations have been proposed. Todor Ganchev, with his team, have compared the most popular four implementations for speaker recognition including the first implementation known as MFCC FB-20 implementation [17]. Among the most popular implementations, MFCC FB-40 implementation has been used in this work. The implementation steps have been discussed below.

But the audio signal is not static, it’s a quasi-stationary signal. This means, that it behaves like static in a short period but changes over a long period. That’s why we need to split the whole audio into some short time frame so that they behave as static and we can measure them on the same scale. The default time limit for this segmentation is 25 ms. As we said most of our data samples have a duration of 10 sec, and the sample rate is 16 kHz, after the framing, there are 400 segments or frames of each audio and each frame has (0.025*16000) = 400 samples.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the major drawbacks of MFCC is it only contains the static information. But when we talk about continuous speech, it has both static and dynamic characteristics depending on the time frame. To retrieve that information, we need to use dynamic features. It has been proven that dynamic features also contain some useful information and a combination of static features and dynamic features can reduce the error rate to half <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> making the model better. So, we used dynamic features known as delta features which are calculated from MFCC by the first-order derivation. This first-order derivation gives us the same number of features we have as MFCC. We have used a combination of MFCC and delta features.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Bangla is the most precious and beloved language for the Bengali people. In this research, we tried to recognize the speaker’s division from Continuous Bengali Speech. We consider Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet, the eight divisions of Bangladesh as the Geographical area. We used our dataset of 45 hours of audio containing Story, News, and Poem scripts from 633 speakers. We performed some preprocessing over our raw audio like labeling, noise reduction, and audio segmentation. We perform feature selection and use MFCC for feature extraction. We applied an Artificial Neural Network to this extracted feature and got the highest accuracy of 85% for speaker division recognition.</p>
