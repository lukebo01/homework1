<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Mental disorders are among the foremost contributors to the global healthcare challenge.
Research indicates that timely diagnosis and intervention are vital in treating various mental disorders. However, the early somatization symptoms of certain mental disorders may not be immediately evident, often resulting in their oversight and misdiagnosis. Additionally, the traditional diagnosis methods incur high time and cost.
Deep learning methods based on fMRI and EEG have improved the efficiency of the mental disorder detection process. However, the cost of the equipment and trained staff are generally huge. Moreover, most systems are only trained for a specific mental disorder and are not general-purpose.
Recently, physiological studies have shown that there are some speech and facial-related symptoms in a few mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD).
In this paper, we focus on the emotional expression features of mental disorders and introduce a multimodal mental disorder diagnosis system based on audio-visual information input. Our proposed system is based on spatial-temporal attention networks and innovative uses a less computationally intensive pre-train audio recognition network to fine-tune the video recognition module for better results. We also apply the unified system for multiple mental disorders (ADHD and depression) for the first time.
The proposed system achieves over 80% accuracy on the real multimodal ADHD dataset and achieves state-of-the-art results on the depression dataset AVEC 2014.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Mental health encompasses an individual’s psychological, emotional, and social well-being, which includes the ability to cope with stress, manage emotions, maintain relationships, and make decisions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. It plays a crucial role in overall health and functioning, influencing thoughts, feelings, and actions in daily life.
Fig. 1 shows the age (years) and gender distribution of patients with a diagnosis of severe mental illness (SMI) compared with all patients recorded by the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS), UK. The results suggest that approximately 5-15 % of recorded patient visits within the 20-60 years age group are impacted by severe mental illness, constituting a substantial overall figure.
Various factors, including genetics, environment, life experiences, and biological factors, can influence mental health. As a result, mental disorders such as depression, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and anxiety are common, particularly among children and adolescents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The traditional diagnosis of mental disorders typically relies on clinicians’ observation, questioning, and consultation, guided by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, this diagnostic process is time-consuming and heavily dependent on the clinician’s experience and judgment, including the long waiting time for the clinical appointment. The timely intervention significantly impacts the treatment of mental disorders and improves the quality of life for patients and their families <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Due to the time-consuming process and the shortage of experienced clinical consultants, it has been reported that the waiting period for diagnoses and treatment of certain mental disorders such as ADHD, depression, and Alzheimer’s can extend to several years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Recently, there has been a growing interest in machine learning methods for mental disorders detection and diagnosis. The majority of research in this area relies on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. These methods efficiently detect and extract neurobiological symptoms and features, leveraging objective brain changes to diagnose subjects.
The conventional MRI and EEG-based methods have two limitations. Firstly, the expensive equipment and high operational costs limit the practical use of MRI and EEG in real-world diagnosis. MRI and EEG scanners cost £150,000-1,000,000 and £1,000-25,000, respectively, and the regular maintenance costs are also very expensive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Secondly, recent detection and diagnosis techniques are specific to one mental disorder. However, many different mental disorders share the same or similar behavioral symptoms, such as dodge expression and uncontrollable body shaking, which are often overlooked by these neurobiological diagnostic techniques.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, there is a growing demand for cost-effective and versatile psychiatric screening methods. In 1980, Russell introduced the concept of emotional states being represented as continuous numerical vectors in a two-dimensional space known as the Valence–Arousal (VA) space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Valence denotes positive and negative emotional states, while arousal indicates the intensity of emotions ranging from sleepiness to high excitement.
As shown in Fig. 2, depression typically occupies the third quadrant of the VA space, while ADHD is predominantly situated in the first and third quadrants. The distinct expression of various mental disorders within emotional space enables possible diagnosis and screening using a unified system. Many mental disorder symptoms manifest as observable emotional swings, which are reflected in both the patient’s speech and facial expressions.</p>

It also highlights that individuals might encounter supplementary physical symptoms, including chronic pain or digestive problems. In the research conducted by Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, they employed a methodology that calculates the two
attributes of brain regions based on the multi-layer network of dynamic functional connections and fuses morphological and
anatomical network features to diagnose depression, resulting in a reasonable classification accuracy of 93.6%. In recent research, machine learning methods based on emotion recognition have also been used in depression assessment. In the research conducted by Niu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, they proposed a representation block to find a set of basis

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed system contains three main parts: video-based facial expression detection, audio-based pre-train model, and classification and regression performance measurements.
Because of the particularity of medical and clinical-related information, open-source mental disorders datasets are relatively limited at this stage. We select multimodal datasets containing real facial video and audio encompassing a broad spectrum of mental disorders, including ADHD and depression.
Fig. 3 illustrates our proposed mental disorder detection system. Details will be introduced in the following subsections.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper primarily focuses on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression. These psychiatric conditions are selected due to their prevalence as the most common mental disorders, each characterized by specific emotional symptoms. Two challenging multimodal datasets, which serve as benchmarks for ADHD and depression detection and assessment, are utilized in the experiments. All datasets used to validate the detection and assessment performance of the proposed system are approved by certified medical authorities.</p>

Each subject and control undergoes a data recording process lasting 10-20 minutes, involving 21 questions selected from the Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults (DIVA) administered in English. Notably, DIVA is a standard questionnaire used by doctors for ADHD diagnosis.
The recording setup involves three GoPro cameras: a front-facing Camera 1 captures facial information, while side Cameras 2 and 3 record the left and right torsos and limbs at a resolution of <math id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="3840\times 2160" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">3840</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">2160</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">3840</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">2160</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">3840\times 2160</annotation></semantics></math> pixels. For our proposed mental disorder assessment and detection system, only facial information captured by Camera 1 is utilized.
Videos are segmented into 60-second clips, and each is labeled as either 0 (non-ADHD controls) or 1 (ADHD subjects). The ADHD dataset used in our proposed system comprises 188 video clips, partitioned into training, validation, and testing at a ratio of 6:1:3, respectively.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For depression detection, we employ the AVEC 2014 dataset to train and evaluate our proposed system. This dataset consists of videos accompanied by BDI-II score labels, self-evaluated by the participants in each video. The labels span from 0 to 63 and are divided into four depression levels: minimal (0–13), mild (14–19), moderate (20–28), and severe (29–63). The AVEC 2014 dataset consists of a total of 300 video recordings,
which are divided into three categories: training, development, and testing sets. Each set contains two different types of video recordings: Freeform and Northwind. The Northwind task involves participants reading aloud the fable ‘The North Wind and the Sun’ in German. The Freeform task requires participants to answer a series of questions in German. The length of each video is approximately between 10 to 60 seconds.</p>

The processed features are then passed through a residual module, which comprises two bottleneck structures.
Notably, the attention module replaces the middle layer of the bottleneck and generates a weighted feature incorporating attention features. Following a stack of residual modules, an adaptive pooling layer resamples the feature into a fixed shape. Finally, the last fully connected layer predicts a score, serving as the output of the proposed system.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For optimal preservation of short-term facial expressions, we initially extract the raw video input as individual images at a 1-frame interval. Our preprocessing utilizes the Dlib toolkit to precisely extract facial landmarks from the sequence of frames, effectively eliminating background interference and aligning human faces to minimize environmental disruptions. As shown in Fig. 4, during alignment, we center the facial features precisely between the eyes and adjust the vertical distance between the eyes and mouth to occupy one-third of the image’s height. Subsequently, the aligned facial images are resized to the dimension of 224 × 224 pixels for further processing.</p>

Fig. 5 shows the audio spectrograms separated by denoising from the original recordings. The noise threshold is determined based on statistical analysis performed across the audio clip.
Following the denoising process, the raw audios are segmented into clips of a 2-second duration and organized within the same structure as the corresponding video dataset.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.2" class="ltx_p">Our proposed system is trained on the AVEC 2014 and the real multimodal ADHD dataset. We subsequently validate and test it on the development/validation and testing sets of both datasets, respectively.
For the training period for the multimodal system, we randomly select a sequence of 64 frames from a given audio-visual recording at a stochastic position to form a training clip. To augment the input data during training, we apply random horizontal flips and adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue within the range of 0 to 0.1 for all frames in one video clip.
During the testing phase, for a given testing audio-visual recording, we crop it into a sub-video with 64 frames and compare it with the indicated audio group, predicting each group to calculate the mean value of depression scores and the ADHD classification probability score. The training epochs for the audio model is 100, with the learning rate empirically set to <math id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1\times 10^{-4}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><msup id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">10</mn><mrow id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mo id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3a" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">4</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">1</cn><apply id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2">10</cn><apply id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><minus id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3"></minus><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2">4</cn></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p4.1.m1.1c">1\times 10^{-4}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned in Section III, our proposed system differs from traditional machine learning approaches based on fMRI and EEG. Instead, it concentrates on creating multimodal systems for detecting and assessing mental disorders using video and audio data collected by common sensors. These multimodal systems have the advantage of correcting or compensating for errors in detection that can arise from single-modality inputs, making them especially valuable for such related medical research.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed system’s performance is evaluated by comparing it with LSTM and 3D-CNN networks on this real multimodal ADHD dataset with precision, accuracy, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) to evaluate the classification performance of the system.
For the results of the AVEC 2014 dataset for depression, we utilize Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
The experimental results are summarized in Table I and Table II.</p>

In this system, the Cov-Attention model captures expression and emotional cues across multiple contiguous frames, utilizing both spatial and temporal dimensions of video data. This model is crucial for accurate diagnosis and classification in related tasks. Additionally, the attention-CNN model in the audio recognition module effectively captures frequency and dimensional features present in speech signals,i.e., enhancing performance in speech-based detection and diagnosis while introducing the pre-train model. Overall, the proposed system exhibits strong performance in the detection tasks of the ADHD multimodal dataset, achieving high accuracy using only cost-effective audio-visual information data.

<p id="S4.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the results of the ablation studies, firstly, both the audio and video-based classification networks exhibit a notable level of robustness in assessing and detecting various psychological and emotional features, underscoring their efficacy in cross-mental disorders.
Secondly, fine-tuning the video model using simple pre-trained audio models leads to significant improvements in classification accuracy and performance across different experiments.
Thirdly, by leveraging the strengths of both network models and exploiting the features from different modalities, we have developed a comprehensive system for assessing and detecting various mental disorders. This integrated approach yields superior performance, particularly evident in depression assessment, where the MAE on the AVEC 2014 dataset is 7.23, and the AUC on the ADHD dataset is 0.77.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The aforementioned results highlight the similar related symptoms in emotional expression, including facial expressions and speech, across different mental disorders. They also indicate the feasibility of evaluating and screening multiple mental disorders through a unified multimodal system.
Moreover, while video-based depression assessment performs slightly better than only audio-based depression assessment, the opposite is observed for ADHD diagnosis. This discrepancy may be attributed to differences in symptom manifestation among various mental disorders. We note that the ADHD data are collected from interview videos, potentially amplifying the prominence of speech characteristics over facial expressions.
In our future work, we intend to delve deeper into these findings through more comprehensive experiments and introduce more multimodal data, such as EEG and fMRI, for fusion and evaluation of the related disorders.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presented an innovative multimodal detection system for identifying and detecting various mental disorders. The proposed system demonstrated state-of-the-art assessment and classification capabilities on depression and ADHD datasets, respectively. By leveraging a simple pre-train audio model to fine-tune video data, our system achieved promising results, as evidenced by comparative and ablation study experiments. Compared to conventional machine learning methods based on EEG and fMRI, our system offered cost-effectiveness and broader applicability, pointing to a promising direction in clinical practice.
For future research, we aim to broaden the scope of our proposed system to encompass a wider array of mental disorders with a larger sample size. It should be noted that this paper aims to explore the application of fusion systems based on audio-visual features in mental disorder assessment and detection. Further feature fusion experiments and more comprehensive detection results will be addressed in this work’s future journal paper.</p>
