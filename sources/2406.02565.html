<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper explores the applicability of sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models based on LSTM units for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task within peer-to-peer learning environments.
Leveraging two distinct peer-to-peer learning methods, the study simulates the learning process of agents and evaluates their performance in ASR task using two different ASR datasets.
In a centralized training setting, utilizing a scaled-down variant of the Deep Speech 2 model, a single model achieved a Word Error Rate (WER) of 84% when trained on the UserLibri dataset, and 38% when trained on the LJ Speech dataset.
Conversely, in a peer-to-peer learning scenario involving 55 agents, the WER ranged from 87% to 92% for the UserLibri dataset, and from 52% to 56% for the LJ Speech dataset.
The findings demonstrate the feasibility of employing Seq2Seq models in decentralized settings, albeit with slightly higher Word Error Rates (WER) compared to centralized training methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models have emerged as a powerful framework in various natural language processing (NLP) and sequence generation tasks, ranging from machine translation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, text summarization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> to even automatic speech recognition (ASR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
However, their application in peer-to-peer deep learning scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, even within the realm of Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, remains relatively under explored.
Peer-to-peer and FL environments are comprised of agents, each holding local private data and preforming local computations, with the primary mode of interaction being the sharing of models with outside entities or other agents.
Agent’s local data is considered as private and must never leave the agent, therefore only the machine learning models are exchanged with other participants in the environment.
In the context of Federated Learning (FL), agents disseminate their trained models solely with a central server, whereas in peer-to-peer settings, agents engage in direct model exchange among themselves, thereby rendering peer-to-peer environments notably more complex scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">An agent, which may be any edge device such as phone or laptop, owns local data which is most likely generated by the agent or the user using the device.
When considering the applications of peer-to-peer learning, the availability of local data must also be considered.
In this context, local textual exchanges or user-generated written content emerge as potential dataset that can be utilized for training neural network models tailored to tasks like next-word prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
In the context of Seq2Seq model applications, an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task presents itself as a viable option.
Users can contribute to the generation of data by orally presenting specific paragraphs or sentences, therefore creating a dataset of audio clips and corresponding textual representations which can be utilized to train a local Seq2Seq model.
The purpose of this study is to investigate if such application of the Seq2Seq model is viable peer-to-peer environment.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In peer-to-peer learning, agents exchange their models following a network topology which is commonly predetermined <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, however, the peer connection between agents can also be established autonomously based on agents’ preferences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Since the topology often dictates the number of neighbors, it is important to note that the communication can be directed or undirected.
In an example of undirected ring topology, each agent has two neighbors, while in the directed ring topology, each agent has only one neighbor.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Each agent’s goal is to train its local model by leveraging its local dataset and information received from its neighbors to minimize its average loss function.
An agent uses this local data to train a local model by calculating mini-batch gradient and updating its local model for predetermined number of batch iterations.
The local training step is followed by a communication step in which agents exchange information.
Scenarios involving multiple agent learning and interacting with eachother are often simulated in memory in a computer, in parallel, i.e., each agent performs training and communication steps in a loop.
Different approaches include different message content exchanged between agents; commonly, an agent must send its message to all its out-neighbors and receive all messages from its in-neighbors.
A loss of a message in this phase may stall the overall learning process since an agent may forever wait for a message that never arrives.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In a synchronous approach, a synchronization barrier is implemented, mandating that agents refrain from proceeding with their learning processes until all messages have been both transmitted and received <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Conversely, an asynchronous approach permits agents to engage in communication and learning activities at their discretion, without significant constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore, variations in the aggregation methodology may arise, with certain techniques involving the aggregation of all received models by computing the average of all model parameters, inclusive of local model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, while in alternative methods, an agent may conduct averaging operations upon each received model in conjunction with its own local model subsequent to reception <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Seq2Seq models consist of two main components: an encoder and a decoder.
In the context of ASR, the encoder processes input speech signals, typically represented as spectrograms or other time-frequency representations, into a fixed-dimensional vector representation, capturing relevant features of the input audio.
The decoder, often implemented as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer architecture, then generates the corresponding text output based on the encoded information.
The most known model architectures regarding the ASR tasks are the <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Listen, Attend and Spell</span> (LAS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and Deep Speech 2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
In this study, Deep Speech 2 model variant will be used to investigate the applicability of the Seq2Seq models in peer-to-peer environments for the ASR task.
In conventional training process (depicted in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II-B Sequence-to-sequence models for ASR ‣ II Background ‣ Sequence-to-sequence models in peer-to-peer learning: A practical application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the audio clip is first converted to a spectrogram which is essentially an image, which is then used as an input to the model.
The model outputs a sequence of token probabilities which is then used to assemble the output sentence.
Based on specific needs, the output may be individual characters or words.
Once the sentence is assembled, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> loss metric is used to evaluate the similarity of the model output as compared to ground truth text that was spoken in the audio clip.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The primary evaluation metric utilized in the assessment of automatic speech recognition systems is the Word Error Rate (WER).
WER quantifies the minimum number of operations, including substitutions, deletions, and insertions, necessary to transform the system’s transcription (prediction) into the reference transcription (ground truth), divided by the total number of words in the reference.
WER is bounded between 0 and infinity, where a lower value indicates better performance.
Often expressed as a percentage, WER is commonly calculated by multiplying the raw score by 100.
For instance, a WER of 0.15 is equivalently represented as 15%.
Extraction of words from a trained model necessitates the utilization of a decoder, which translates a probability distribution over characters into textual output.
Two primary types of decoders are typically employed with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based models: the greedy decoder and the beam search decoder with language model re-scoring.
The greedy decoder selects the most probable character at each time step, facilitating rapid inference and generating transcripts closely resembling the original pronunciation.
However, this approach may introduce numerous minor misspelling errors, which, given the nature of the WER metric, render entire words incorrect with even a single character discrepancy.
Conversely, the beam search decoder with language model re-scoring explores multiple potential decodings concurrently, assigning higher scores to more probable N-grams based on a specified language model.
Integration of the language model aids in rectifying misspelling errors.
Nevertheless, this approach is notably slower in comparison to the greedy decoder.
For simplicity and speed, this study utilizes the greedy decoder.</p>

A single RNN GRU layer with 512 units is used to constrain the number of model parameters. GRU layer is followed by a Fully connected layer, Dropout layer, and the final Fully connected output layer.
The resulting model is comprised of 7.7M model parameters which is of acceptable size for edge devices, and satisfactory for this use case since the goal is to evaluate the applicability of Seq2Seq models in peer-to-peer environments, rather than achiveing state-of-the-art results.
To reduce memory consumption and improve the training process, batch size is set to 8.
Adam <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> optimizer with a fixed learning rate of 0.0001 is used in all experiments.
Model predicts the probabilities of each individual character of English alphabet and uses the greedy decoder to select the most probable character at each time step.</p>

<p id="S4.p5.9" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.p5.9.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Methodology.</span>
The learning process of agents was emulated in memory using two distinct peer-to-peer learning methodologies: Pull-gossip <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and P2P-BN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
This simulation engenders a cyclical process wherein each local training step is succeeded by a communication step, with these phases iteratively recurring.
A directed <span id="S4.p5.9.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sparse</span> network topology with three peer connections was utilized for both methods.
In the Pull-gossip approach, upon pulling models from its peers, an agent forms a new model by aggregating all received models using a weighted summation mechanism: <math id="S4.p5.1.m1.1"

This allocation represents a considerable increase, exceeding threefold, in training data availability compared to the experiment conducted with the UserLibri dataset.
Consistent with prior experiments, peer-to-peer learning necessitated a notable increase in training iterations to achieve model convergence.
However, it is noteworthy that the number of training iterations until convergence remained comparable to previous experiments, suggesting that increase of local data solely enhanced model performance without necessitating a commensurate increase in communication or training iterations.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, this discussion has shed light on the utilization of Seq2Seq models in both centralized and peer-to-peer learning environments for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks.
While centralized training on pooled data from all users demonstrated more efficient convergence and lower Word Error Rates (WER), peer-to-peer learning, where each agent independently trains its own model using local data, showcased promising potential despite requiring more training iterations to achieve comparable results.
These findings underscore the applicability of Seq2Seq models in peer-to-peer settings.
However, a critical observation gleaned from the experiments is the pivotal role played by the availability and richness of local training data across decentralized agents.
The correlation between larger local datasets and lower Word Error Rates (WER) on the LJ Speech dataset underscores the importance of data quantity in achieving optimal performance with Seq2Seq models. However, it’s crucial not to assume this constraint for decentralized agents, as they may not have access to substantial amounts of local data. Therefore, future research endeavors should prioritize the exploration and development of methods that enable robust learning performance for Seq2Seq models, even in scenarios where agents have access to only small quantities of data
Additionally, future research endeavors should focus on addressing challenges such as slow convergence rates in peer-to-peer learning and devising techniques to expedite the learning process, thereby facilitating more efficient and scalable deployment of Seq2Seq models in decentralized settings.</p>
